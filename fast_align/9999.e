located in the country 's northwestern border , yili has served as an important window during the country 's opening up to the outside world . since reform and opening up , yili has developed the economy by a large margin and rapidly improved the people 's livelihood .
however , restricted by communications and telecommunication conditions , a vast number of farmers and herdsmen living in the remote mountainous areas and rural areas have been unable to accurately learn in a timely fashion the party 's and state 's principles and policies .
in order to coordinate with the propaganda activity , the autonomous prefecture authorities and prefecture authorities especially organized personnel to compile and make the videotapes , cassettes , pictures , and materials concerned in the uyghur language , the kazakh language , and the han language .
when giving a propaganda lecture at the gegangou pasture in huocheng county , the propaganda team concerned especially staged an aken singing and playing performance . some people had hurried to the scene from areas some 30 kilometers away one day before .
as the propaganda activity was conducted in a way welcomed by the masses and with the local realities fully taken into account , it received an enthusiastic response from the masses .
in many rural areas , the masses sat on the grassland , in the football fields , or under the trees and conscientiously listened to the propaganda lectures .
while abulimiti , deputy secretary general of the yili prefecture administrative office , was giving a propaganda lecture in a township in yining county , it suddenly rained .
after listening to a propaganda lecture , given the strong atmosphere and appeal of the propaganda activity , some people would even follow the propaganda team to other villages where they would listen to the same propaganda lecture again .
" thanks to this activity , we have heard about and watched a lot of things , including those we have never heard of or seen before .
we could easily understand what they said and learn a lot of things from them , " sighed the masses in yining county and huocheng county , who had listened to the lectures .
we 're illiterate , know very little , and cannot convince the young people . you 've given a very good lecture . you should come here more often in future . "
yibulayin , a farmer from alamutuya village of yingyeer township in yining city , said : " a country is just like a family and the government is just like a parent . if the parent often teaches his children , his children will make fewer mistakes . "
when i first came here , i thought that it would be difficult for us to gather the villagers together and even if we could gather them together , some of them would leave the site before a propaganda lecture ended .
later on , when i saw our propaganda team welcomed by the masses wherever it went and a large number of people coming to listen to our propaganda lectures , i myself was greatly educated .
while carrying out the propaganda activity , the propaganda team members displayed a spirit of bearing hardships and enduring hard work .
in the ganjiahu pasture of wusu city , the propaganda team members carried with them their own food and traveled by vehicles for several hundred kilometers for seven consecutive days , going into the households to give propaganda lectures .
in those seven days , in order to save time , they ate dry crusty pancakes and drank plain boiled water during the day and lived in the herdsmen 's yurts at night .
sometimes , they would especially rush to an area in order to give a propaganda lecture to only a few people .
apart from sparing no effort to carry out the propaganda activity from village to village , the propaganda team members also find time to help the local people tackle difficulties and problems in their production and livelihood and joined them in fighting the floods and providing disaster relief .
beijing , 28 jan - - the shuguang 2000 - ii superserver successfully developed by the state intelligent machinery research and development center of the chinese academy of science computer institute passed in beijing today the specialists ' appraisal conducted by the ministry of science and technology .
song jian , vice chairman of the national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference and president of the chinese academy of engineering , attended the appraisal meeting .
high - performance computing is divided into scientific engineering computing and non - scientific engineering computing , with the latter including business processing and network information services , accounting for more than 90 percent of the total .
the traditional supercomputers are good at the scientific engineering computing only , while this super - server is good at both , thus being the mainstream of the high - end computers .
according to the statistics released in november 1999 , among the world 's 500 installed computers with the fastest theoretical operations speeds , 372 were super - servers , with their number tending to increase .
with an advanced machines system set - up , this super - server is composed of 82 nodal computers and 164 processors .
the shuguang 2000 - ii super server is equipped with abundant and complete software .
china has manufactured by itself a high - performance machine operation system that is supplemented with many kinds of popular high - class program languages and mainstream parallel programming environments and means .
to support its network information service , this super server is also installed with parallel network and e - mail service software , thus being able to support all kinds of popular database software .
beijing , 4 feb ( xinhua ) - - the chinese government announced at the turn of the century that one of its economic priorities would be to speed up the development of its western parts .
economists here maintain that the strategy of developing western china was a timely one .
according to the concept , central and western china should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .
then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western china speed up its development with even more resources in return .
moreover , owing to the deflation trend , the state has adopted certain active fiscal policies to boost the economy , creating the situation where the government can afford to support the development of the west with even more resources .
according to zeng peiyuan , minister in charge of the state development planning commission , this year the government will draw up additional preferential policies for encouraging foreign businesses to invest in western china and will spend more loans from international organizations on construction projects in the west .
according to the experts , china 's economic development in recent years has been hindered by inadequate demand at home , and considerable portion of technology and labor are seeking new areas of production , new markets , and new areas of development .
on its part , the sprawling western china with rich natural resources offers enormous investment opportunities as well as market and development potentials .
the development of western china will provide vast areas for the nation 's economic restructuring and industrial optimization and escalation .
china has basically addressed the problem of feeding the people . its food supply is higher than demand . this has created the rare opportunity for the development of western china .
in the past , western china , in order to address its food problem , had to destroy its woodlands for subsistence , causing serious ravage to its environment .
the present food surplus can specifically serve the purpose of helping western china restore its woodlands , grasslands , and the beauty of its landscapes .
the reason why the central authorities have attached such great importance to the planning work for the western region development is that a good plan is the crux of making the first step toward the development of west china .
our forefathers said : preparedness ensures success , and unpreparedness spells failure , which means that in doing everything , it is necessary to make thorough preparations and well - conceived plans .
the large - scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .
for instance , the land in west china accounts for more than one - half of the country 's total , where construction of infrastructure facilities should be reinforced , construction of water conservancy and communication works is necessary , and construction projects of basic industries are indispensable too .
the central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .
making a scientific plan will help maintain unflagging enthusiasm and enhance the prudent and rational spirit , so that good intentions will reap good results and the large - scale development of the western region will obtain great achievements .
it is precisely on the basis of summing up the experiences and lessons in the economic construction for years that the central authorities proposed that all the major construction projects of the western region development should be included in the plans for sufficient verification .
a scientific plan has both its guiding function and binding force .
without the guidance of a plan , there will probably emerge such a tendency that those who are in power or who hold higher positions have the final say .
with a plan , however , the practices involving a lot of paper work , considerations for sensibilities , and protection of local interests can be avoided .
in short , making a good plan at the beginning of the construction is the crucial measure for reducing haphazard economic development .
to be authoritative , a plan must be scientific and conform to the objective reality .
to draw up an authoritative plan , we must also pay attention to coordination and comprehensive equilibrium .
for the western region development , various sectors , trades , and departments of the national economy are obligated to make plans .
in terms of ecological construction alone , the departments of forestry , water conservancy , agriculture , and land should participate in devising plans . various departments must work in cooperation with division of labor , and the plans must be well linked and coordinated to avoid disharmony .
as a dozen provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions as well as the xinjiang production and construction corps are involved in the western development , various localities , especially the neighboring provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , must coordinate with one another in drafting plans .
if they only proceed from the interests of their own provinces , areas , or units regardless of the overall situation of the western development , they are unable to play a harmonious and resonant symphony for the development of west china .
there is a relationship of mutual promotion between experiments and plans , and between the selected spots and the entire areas , and the experience gained in the selected spots can serve the purpose of perfecting the plans and help carry out the work in a comprehensive way .
while fully affirming this enthusiasm , we should also pay attention to avoiding over - enthusiastic and blind actions . if the experimental scope is too large at the beginning , then the meaning of making experiments in selected points no longer exists .
what we need to emphasize is that in making plans or experiments , or even in carrying out the future comprehensive development , two things must be respected : 1 ) the market law must be respected .
2 ) the masses ' wishes must be respected , and their initiative and creativeness must be brought into full play .
news that has recently spread here indicates that some localities in the western region have introduced or are studying the introduction of preferential policies , hoping to import funds from the eastern region and foreign countries through various methods .
of course , this is extremely necessary , but we must note that making a good plan is equally very important .
once their doubts and misgivings are cleared , they will vie with one another to make bold investment in the western region .
therefore , making a good plan is conducive to creating a fully appealing investment environment .
wen jiabao fully affirmed that in 1999 our nation made remarkable achievements in water conservancy construction , and hoped that the cadres and staff on the battle lines of water conservancy would continue their efforts , complete this year 's missions , and achieve even greater accomplishments .
he made the following requests with regard to several important issues in water conservancy : first , complete planning .
scientific , complete water conservancy construction plans must be drawn up in accordance with the demands of the overall mission and overall goals of national economic and social development , and must be in line with overall planning for national economic and social development .
drawing up plans must be treated as an important and pressing mission ; and , as a task fundamental to the strengthening of water conservancy construction , it must be diligently carried out in a controlled manner .
the ministry of water resources must draw up a comprehensive national plan for water conservancy construction development to be used in guiding the work of water conservancy nationwide .
flood prevention and development plans must also be drawn up for the major river basins .
at the same time , plans for various types of special projects must be put in place .
water conservancy projects within a river basin must all be carried out under the guidance of the overall plan and the plan for the river basin .
second , comprehensive management .
serious flooding , the scarcity of water resources , erosion , and worsening water pollution are currently the most important issues , and comprehensive management must be carried out .
flood prevention is the primary mission , and it is also work that must be done frequently and diligently .
flood prevention must be integrated with water conservation , ecological protection , and pollution prevention and control .
in addition , non - engineering measures such as meteorology , hydrology , monitoring , communications , information systems , and the like must be strengthened .
water conservancy projects must establish management while placing emphasis on the right things , which means that while project quality must be taken seriously , maintenance and upkeep must also be strengthened .
third , emphasize important points .
proper handling requires making the relationships among what is possible , the current situation and the long - term .
according to the unified plan , major issues relating to the national economy and people 's livelihood and urgent problems are resolved first , and moreover are integrated with the fulfillment of long - range planning goals .
according to the request made by general secretary jiang zemin , we must insist on taking time to reach decisions , comprehensive consideration , scientific selections and comparisons , and meticulous designs for major water conservancy projects .
the establishment and design of projects must be fully debated and repeated comparisons must be made in order to make the project stand the test of time .
fourth , ensure project quality .
this is critical to strengthening water conservancy construction management .
in the recent period of time , in accordance with requests from the central government and relevant national regulations , the ministry of water resources has taken a series of measures to strengthen project quality management , and has achieved remarkable success .
however , many problems still remain in water conservancy projects .
the key to solving these problems lies in emphasizing the word strict , as in strict demands , strict management , and strict execution of the system of rules and regulations . not one link can be left out in ensuring the quality of water conservancy projects .
wen jiabao stressed that flood prevention and drought resistance relate to the lives , property , and security of the people , and must be given high regard at all times .
second , we must implement a flood - prevention responsibility system , strengthen pre - flood inspections , and implement flood prevention measures .
this has been a cold winter , and we must put particular emphasis on the work of preventing flooding due to melting ice on northern rivers .
third , we must raise the level of modern flood - prevention and drought resistance technology .
establish modernized meteorological , hydrological , and communications facilities , strengthen analysis and research of rainfall and water conditions , and improve the accuracy of forecasting .
he called on the comrades at the national prevention office to be faithful in the discharge of their duties , diligent and responsible , and to serve selflessly to raise the scientific level and efficiency of the work .
the state council leadership group for west china development has an office subordinate to it ; a specific organ has been set up in the state development and planning commission , to undertake the day to day work of the leadership group .
zeng peiyan is director and wang chunzheng and duan yingbi are the deputy directors of this office .
china formally proposed implementing the strategy of major development of west china at the national economic work conference last year .
having been discussed until early this year , this major development strategy is gradually heating up . clues to the thinking on western development are also being gradually revealed .
from 19 to 22 january the state council leadership group for west china development held a conference in beijing on western development , at which premier zhu rongji set out the scheme for this development , so that the work can get comprehensively started as soon as possible .
since last august premier zhu rongji has taken leading members of the state council on many visits to the western provinces and autonomous regions to prepare the plans for western development ; he has also put forward specific guidelines and policies for this work .
as has been proven in practice over the past five years , president jiang zemin 's important speech has a very important guiding significance in developing cross - strait relations and promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .
during the exchanges and mutual visits , people of the same trades from the trade unions of both sides expressed their feelings of hope for reunification and opposition to separation .
millions of staff and workers and trade unions at all levels throughout the country resolutely oppose this criminal act to split the motherland .
gu xiulian , vice president of the all - china women 's federation , said : president jiang zemin 's important speech has an important significance in practice .
the successful practice of the principle of " one country , two systems " in the hong kong and macao special administrative regions has won heartfelt support from the large numbers of hong kong and macao compatriots .
the principle of " one country , two systems " has been understood and accepted by more and more people .
today when we have entered the new century , settling the taiwan issue and ultimately accomplishing the sacred mission of the reunification of the motherland have emerged prominently in front of all chinese people , including taiwan compatriots .
the all - china women 's federation will continue to expand the exchanges and contacts with taiwan women and play its due role in achieving peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait at an early date and opposing the splittist forces in taiwan .
history has proven and will continue to prove that only with the reunification of the motherland can the nation be revitalized comprehensively , and only with national unity can a more brilliant tomorrow be created .
bayinqolu said that in the new century , youths on both sides of the strait should cooperate and work hard together to attain the magnificent goal of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
what they regret , however , is that cross - strait ties have developed in tortuous fashion over the past five years .
following the reversion of hong kong and taiwan to the motherland , the issue of settling the taiwan problem is conspicuously facing the entire chinese people .
chen zhengtong said that the taiwan people have a glorious patriotic tradition ; their aspirations to keep their way of life unchanged and to be masters in their own house are fully understood and respected by the cpc and the chinese people 's government .
this is because there is only one china , and taiwan is part of chinese territory ; this is undeniable fact , and no force can change in any way taiwan 's status as a part of chinese territory .
as a taiwan compatriot , he expressed resolute support for president jiang zemin 's eight - point proposal on taiwan .
he greatly appreciated president jiang zemin 's remarks in the proposals on " strive to achieve peaceful reunification , chinese should not fight chinese . "
he believes that the taiwan problem is a matter left over from the chinese civil war , but no chinese wants another bloody war like that , and the taiwan compatriots on the mainland and their relatives in taiwan do not want it either .
the taiwan people can only achieve happiness through reunification ; and only through reunification can the taiwan compatriots , together with the people of all nationalities in china , truly share in the international dignity and honor of the great motherland .
people on both sides of the strait entertain ardent hopes .
the largest newspaper in macao " ao men jih pao ( macao daily ) " released a commentary today , slashing the us house of representatives ' passage of " taiwan security enhancement act " bill .
this was to pave the way for the united states to provide advanced weapons to taiwan , and include taiwan in the tmd [ theater missile defense ] the commentary said that the united states ignored the consequences and incorporated the security of other countrys under its own law .
the commentary urged the us government to keep their promises of not letting the bill be enacted into law , which would bring endless troubles .
tang jiaxuan notes in his message : china and the world need each other in their development .
it will come up with grand projects and accomplish them , and it will act as a good advisor and assistant to the cpc central committee and the state council .
gao changli says in his message : judicial bodies have special responsibilities to bear while undertaking the great task of managing the country by law .
sun jiazheng says : in 2000 , china 's cultural exchanges with foreign countries will continue to expand , and we will continue to upgrade our cultural exchange programs and improve their quality .
we will make earnest efforts to organize the many large cultural exchange programs , such as the " great get - together of the century , " the second shanghai international art festival , and the sixth china art festival .
beijing , 31 january ( zhongguo xinwen she ) - - today china announced last year 's results of the crackdown on smuggling and declared that large - scale smuggling has been more or less brought under control .
last year , china cracked over 21,000 cases of smuggling and trafficking in smuggled goods , worth 12.7 billion yuan .
the public and the business community have truly felt that the government is cracking down on smuggling with unprecedented determination and forcefulness .
the general administration of customs alone has investigated and handled 13 officials at the level of provincial department head or equivalent and 50 officials at the level of provincial section head or equivalent who have violated discipline and law .
- - measures for comprehensive improvement have been implemented and powerful joint forces have developed in the antismuggling campaign .
over 6,000 enterprises that conducted import and export business in violation of laws and regulations have been penalized and the networking of computers among relevant departments has plugged the loopholes that smugglers would otherwise have taken advantage of .
- - the law enforcement departments have continually conducted large - scale specialized antismuggling operations by focusing on key areas , key channels , and key commodities and kept up the high pressure on smuggling .
as the smugglers itch for action , the antismuggling forces must not allow themselves " a breathing spell . "
the responsible persons at customs emphasized that it is necessary to administer customs strictly and resolutely purge each and every " borer " discovered with no leniency whatsoever .
his message reads : on the occasion of the joyous spring festival , i wish the motherland to be prosperous , wealthy , and strong , and the people happy and healthy .
the development of the western region will meet tremendous obstacles if the problem of the resources of human talents is not solved .
now a task of top priority is to quickly build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types who can meet the strategic needs of the massive development of the western region as well as a contingent of high - quality cadres .
it is believed that with the further implementation of the strategy for the massive development of the western region , there will be certainly more and more qualified personnel swarming to that region , injecting fresh blood into the region 's contingent of qualified personnel .
party organizations at various levels in the western region should seize the day , seize the hour ; with a sense of historic urgency and responsibility , they should speed up the selection , training , or education of qualified personnel .
by carrying out those measures , we should vigorously improve the age , educational , and professional structures of leading bodies at various levels in order to increase their vitality .
while continuing to do a good job in selecting and sending cadres to xinjiang and tibet , we should step up our efforts to train young cadres of various types to meet the needs of the development of the western region .
we should effectively strengthen the building of the contingent of minority nationality cadres in order to adapt ourselves to the new situation .
experts and scholars from institutions of higher learning and managerial personnel from economically developed areas should be invited to conduct scientific and technological training classes or give lectures to impart knowledge of advanced science and technology and of modern management to cadres .
to meet the socialist market economy 's requirements for the allocation of qualified personnel , party organizations at various levels in the western region should quickly develop a standard personnel market .
in the past , as a result of rapid economic development and preferential policy on personnel in the eastern region , some qualified personnel in the western region went there to work .
how can s & t training for troops be made scientific ?
these trainers employ new knowledge , new skills , new methods , and new measures as they execute 847 outstanding training subjects .
guangzhou military region also concentrated on the missions of a theater of operations , and created a series of military theories , combat methods , and training methods characteristic of a theater of operations , and put these to the test in military exercises .
the revolution in science and technology that took place in the world economy at the end of the twentieth century , comprised of information technology , biomedicine , new materials , new energy , and aerospace technology , brought with it an inherent tendency toward accelerated development .
the high - tech industrial groups that grew out of this have gradually become the most important sources of economic growth for every nation .
against this background , if china is to be incorporated into the world economy , it is essential that we accelerate the development of high - tech industry , enhance the overall national strength , and improve this industry 's standing in terms of the international division of labor .
in the course of more than 20 years of development under the reform and opening up policies , china 's economy has undergone a historic change .
in particular , china has formulated a great many policies and measures to promote the development of high - tech industry , such that today this industry has considerable scope and a well - established foundation .
there are more than 50,000 high - tech enterprises in china , and 53 national high - tech development zones have been established .
in manufacturing , a host of industries subject to intellectual property rights and enjoying competitive advantage are currently taking shape . their domestic market share is gradually expanding , and they are also opening up space on the international market .
however , we still have a situation where drastic surplus of low added - value , low - tech products coincides with insufficient effective demand for high - tech products , and the resulting structural conflicts are very conspicuous .
only by accelerating the development of high technology and its related industries will we activate the qualitative leap in industrial structures and technological standards and capacities that will transform china in the 21st century from a great industrialized nation into an industrial power .
in the 20th century , beginning from the early 1990's , china 's information industry has consistently shown an annual growth rate of more than 30 percent , and this makes it one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the national economy .
within the next ten years , computers , electronic communications , software , and display technologies will all see significant breakthroughs , and the trend toward digitization , network - based information , and intelligent capability is already irreversible .
it is for this reason that the market outlook for the information industry in china is so optimistic . it is estimated that by the year 2010 this industry 's market capacity will reach 6 trillion rmb .
clearly , development of the information industry will become one of the important forces driving economic development in the new century .
- - to speed up the industrialization of high technology , and promote the maturation of newly - emerging industries .
after several decades of construction , china now certainly enjoys many of the conditions that favor accelerated development of high - tech industry , such as an adequate pool of human resources , and the requisite industrial base , technology reserves , market conditions , and funds penetration .
- - to strengthen the assimilation of traditional industry to high technology , and promote the improvement and upgrading of traditional industry .
traditional industry still has very weak technological foundations , but while it is hard pressed to adapt itself to the intensity of international competition , it does still control the development of the future .
therefore , promoting the improvement and upgrading of traditional industry is one of the most important responsibilities connected with developing high - tech industry in china .
at the same time , traditional industry also offers high - tech industries a very broad market in which to expand .
this type of interdependence and mutual stimulus would be difficult to ignore .
hong kong , 5 february (xna) - - people living in the chung uk village of lam tsuen in tai po in the new territories today had an unexpected first day of the lunar new year , the year of the dragon .

shelley lau , director of home affairs , and other people accompanied tung chee - hwa and his wife to visit the chung - uk village .
beijing , 6 feb ( xinhua ) - - the china development bank has adopted effective measures to actively ward off and resolve financial risks .
moscow , 6 feb ( xinhua ) - - the russian federation security council , chaired by acting prime minister putin , recently approved the draft of a new military doctrine .
the new doctrine stresses that when russia itself and its allies suffer aggression , and a war aimed at destroying russia cannot be stopped by conventional weapons , russia has the right to use nuclear weapons .
this shows that russia will be the first to launch a nuclear attack , when it believes it necessary .
the new military doctrine also lays down that the armed forces can be used to strike at illegal armed forces and crime within russia and to preserve the state constitution and social stability .
according to the new military doctrine , russia can counterattack with nuclear weapons even if the enemy attacks russia and its allies with non - nuclear weapons , but they will never use nuclear weapons against other countries if russia and its allies are not subject to external aggression .
the russian military emphasizes that the new military doctrine gives russia the right to take the initiative in launching a nuclear strike against the enemy .
the doctrine formulated in 1993 had laid down that russia could only use nuclear weapons in response to a nuclear attack .
the background to russia 's formulation of its new military doctrine is the dramatic changes in the internal and external situation in recent years and the ever - growing external threat that russia faces .
in march 1999 , nato set in motion its chariot of eastward expansion by formally accepting poland , hungary , and the czech republic as new members .
the three baltic states and certain mideast countries are also eager to try to join nato at an early date .
nato 's eastward expansion posed a direct threat to russian security interests .
after that , ignoring the opposition of many countries , including russia , and without un authorization , us - led nato wantonly waged a 78 - day large - scale air war against the yugoslav federation .
acting russian prime minister putin specifically pointed out at the recent russian federation security council meeting that the new military doctrine is " a reply to nato . "
this means that russia now regards us - led nato as its " no . 1 imaginary enemy . "
yeshin , director of the military construction bureau of the council , said that due to its economic difficulties and shortage of military funds , russia cannot fight a conventional war with nato for the foreseeable future .
in order to be respected by others , it is essential to maintain nuclear potential and regard nuclear weapons as " political instruments for curbing the enemy . "
internally , the separatist activities of the illegal chechen militia threaten regional security and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation .
all kinds of gang crimes have become a major factor affecting social stability and economic growth .
military experts point out that unless the russian authorities send in their armed forces , it is hardly imaginable that victory could be won in the chechen war .
hence , the military doctrine by which the russian armed forces were only used to deal with external aggression no longer suits today 's reality .
military analysts here believe that the new russian military doctrine is an expansion and extension in the military sphere of the " russian security concept " which was adopted in january , and is also a " war warning . "
nato will think thrice about taking major military action again that threatens russia and its allies .
nuclear arms will play a still greater deterrent role as the " trump cards " preserving russia 's great power status and vital interests .

hong kong , 6 feb ( xinhua ) - - to celebrate the arrival of the year of the dragon according to the lunar calendar , hong kong held a fireworks show in victoria harbor this evening .
the 23 - minute nine - part fireworks show began at 0800 pm [ 1200 gmt ] .

tung chee - hwa , chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region , presided over the " ceremony to light the auspicious dragon lantern " and watched the fireworks show with hong kong people .
in this year 's new year fireworks show featuring a large number of series of varieties , fireworks of more than 200 varieties in 16 series were used .

the new hampshire primaries have consolidated gore 's front - runner position and further boosted his strength to win the presidential nomination of the democratic party .
bush got 30 percent of the vote , placing him second .
analysts believe that the new hampshire primary means that bush is facing a serious new challenge , and also shows that the struggle for the republican party nomination is getting much hotter .
new hampshire is situated in the northeastern part of the united states , with a population of only ten million .
however , this little state occupies a decisive position during the presidential primaries , and not only can it make the next president , it can also bury the political prospects of presidential candidates .
the situation over the past 10 -20 years shows that most of those who gain the white house have won in the new hampshire primaries .
former presidents eisenhower , carter , reagan , and bush were all victors in the new hampshire primaries .
gore is the only democratic party presidential candidate in the past twenty years who has won in both iowa and new hampshire .
his campaign strategy relies heavily on the economic card , energetically touting the economic achievements since he and clinton took office as well as claiming that only he has the experience and the ability to " maintain america 's prosperity . "
bradley tried to turn the situation around in new hampshire after his resounding defeat in the iowa primary , but was ineffective .
gore said that the new hampshire primary was a " crushing blow " to bradley .
however , bradley has indicated that he will not withdraw from the race , but will rally his forces and challenge gore in the upcoming primaries .
the new hampshire primaries have turned the original five - man race in the republican party into a two - man struggle , with fight for the nomination being primarily between bush and mccain .
mccain did not enter the campaign in iowa , making new hampshire his main battlefield instead .
there he adopted the campaign strategy of " concentrating superior forces , " throwing more time and money into it than any other candidate did and organizing more than 100 voter rallies statewide .
in the polls conducted before the primary , support for mccain exceed that for bush for eight weeks in a row .
mccain hopes the victory in new hampshire will be a springboard to winning the presidential nomination .
during the campaign , bush stated that his large tax cut plan represents the interest of conservative republicans , and that he is the only one with the ability to take back the white house in the presidential election in november .
he charged that mccain 's tax cut plan was similar to that of clinton 's .
bush indicated that the new jersey primary was only a " stumble on the road to the white house , " and that he was fully confident that he would win the republican presidential nomination .
mccain has been a congressman for many years . he was in the vietnam war , and spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war .
he believes that , because he has served longer in government than bush and also was in the vietnam war that he is the best choice as a presidential candidate .
mccain advocates a moderate tax cut , saying that the budget surplus should be used to pay off the national debt and for the social security system and medical insurance programs .
he has indicated that he would pursue campaign finance reforms to eliminate money 's influence in politics .
public opinion believes that in new hampshire , independents voters - - who are neither democratic nor republican - - account for as much as 40 percent , and this part of the electorate played an important role in mccain 's primary victory .
following new hampshire , gore and bradley will start a new round of competition on march 7 .
at that time , 16 states nationwide will conduct primaries on the same day .
if bradley continues to decline , pressure within the party may force him to withdraw from the race .
prior to the 7 march primaries , the republican presidential candidates will also confront each other again in delaware , south carolina , arizona , and michigan .
the world economic forum 's first meeting of the new millennium held in the small town of davos in eastern switzerland spanned six days and came to a close on 1 february .
the focus of this annual meeting is no longer on how to resolve the thorny crisis situation ; rather it is to explore the more basic , long - term issues in world economic development .
at the beginning of the new millennium , the participants took advantage of this gathering to explore new ideas and chart a new course for world development in the new century .
economic globalization has made the countries around the world increasingly more dependent on one another for economic development .
the united states ' economy has been the engine driving world economic growth in recent years .
to date , that economy has sustained 107 months of continuous growth .
in the " new economic " era , when information technology continues to drive economic growth , the united states ' economy continues to have growth potential , but there is also potential danger in their stock market bubble and soaring corporate and personal debt .
for this reason , the participants paid special attention to the prospects of the united states ' economic development , especially whether it can continue to spur world economic growth .
in addition , china 's economy as a growing force to be reckoned with in the global economy is another area that attracted much attention .
wu bangguo said china 's development cannot be separated from the rest of the world , and world prosperity also needs china .
upon joining the wto , china will enjoy its rights but will also fulfill its obligations .
in view of the failure of the minister - level wto meeting in seattle , many participants wondered when another round of multilateral trade talks should be launched .
british prime minister tony blair said the international community should learn from the failure of the seattle meeting and let a new round of negotiations bring forth more benefits even sooner .
he proposed forming an " eminent persons group " to make plans for improving the wto 's work method and hoped a tentative program could be worked out by this summer .
at the same time , representatives of the developing countries expressed great concern for the widening gap between the rich and the poor in the electronic age .
south africa 's president mbeki said that the information revolution brought by the internet has further widened the gap between the developing and the developed countries .
he said that to narrow the gap , the developing countries must unite and take the same stand in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations to make it a bona fide " development round . "
at this annual meeting of the world economic forum , president arafat of the palestinian authority described in his speech a construction blueprint for the middle east after achieving peace there .
he once again called upon the international community to take steps to salvage the peace process so that the middle east people can look forward to a peaceful , free , and prosperous new century .
this annual meeting was held at the beginning of the new millennium under fairly good world economic conditions , but klaus schwab , founder of the world economic forum , said at the opening ceremony on the 27th that people must not be complacent .
wan guoquan , president of the china council for promoting peaceful reunification , spoke at the meeting .
china will practice an even more relaxed policy than the ones applied to hong kong and macao to solve the taiwan issue under the framework of the " one country , two systems . "
he expressed the belief that through cross - strait talks , a solution can surely be found that will not only satisfy the wishes and demands of taiwan compatriots but also fully take into consideration the interests of various social classes in taiwan .
the hard - working , brave , clever , and wise chinese people can surely solve their own affairs and will finally realize the motherland 's complete reunification .
more and more taiwan compatriots will finally come to believe that the " one country , two systems " is the best way to safeguard the interests of all concerned .
the forum was chaired by wang wenyuan , vice chairman of the national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference and president of the china council for promoting peaceful reunification .
wang xiaofeng gave the above statement at the forum .
as the sons and daughters of the chinese nation , we will surely realize the complete reunification of the motherland and the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation at an early date .
in the meantime , he also affirmed the contributions made by taiwan compatriots in hainan 's development and construction .
he pointed out : since the establishment of the province 12 years ago , 1,274 taiwan - invested enterprises have made investments totaling $ 1.2 billion in hainan . taiwan - invested enterprises have made positive contributions to hainan 's development and construction .
representatives of taiwan compatriots , taiwan businessmen , family members of taiwan compatriots and related organs and mass organizations gave speeches at the forum one after another .
lee ch 'iung - mei , vice president of the provincial committee of the all - china federation of taiwan compatriots , said : president jiang zemin 's speech given five years ago showed strong affections and sincerity , having a very strong influential power .
the reunification of the motherland and family reunion symbolize the love of compatriots and the basic demands of national sentiments .
cai changsong , deputy secretary of the hainan provincial cpc committee ; hong shouxiang , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department ; and li dongsheng and wang qiongying , vice governors of hainan province , attended the forum .
it said : life will only become harder if us forces are garrisoned for the long term in kosovo .
last march , us - led nato flaunted the banner of humanitarianism , and wantonly and indiscriminately bombed the federal republic of yugoslavia [ fry ] without un security council authorization .
the 78 - day military operation gravely trampled on the " un charter " and international laws , and caused heavy casualties and property losses in the fry .
for a period of time , the us government , public , and media boasted enormously about their victory and were insufferably arrogant .
however , as time goes by , some people have to admit that the severity of the outcome of this war is unexpected .
ethnic conflicts have intensified further instead of disappearing after us - led nato troops were garrisoned in kosovo in the name of un peacekeeping .
not only have violent conflicts escalated in kosovo , but nato troops have become the target of attacks .
the albanian " kosovo liberation army " [ kla ] supported vigorously by nato troops has persisted in its old ways , has conflicted with serbs now and then , and also constantly has open fights with nato troops .
some people in the united states exclaimed : us forces are in the albanian and serb " crossfire , " and could well be " drawn into the danger of kosovo civil war . "
the " sitelatefu association " article said : now , the us government is considering " redefining " its kosovo policy , and the core will be military withdrawal from kosovo .
us defense secretary cohen flew to munich last week , hoping also to work on the european allies .
he complained : us forces serve as policemen in kosovo but lack the training required , and the us government does not wish them to do such work . the kosovo situation has the tendency to get out of control , and the european allies should shoulder more obligations .
according to us claims , the european allies have agreed to garrison police units in kosovo , and will form a multinational force before april this year to uphold peace in kosovo , so that us forces can extricate themselves .
however , in reality , the european allies have no such desire .
european countries , besides britain , lacked enthusiasm in the kosovo military operation in the first place , and flinch from advancing forward now that they are faced with such a chaotic situation .
some people even believe that the united states asked for it since it refused to heed advice initially and had made a mess of things .
people here opined : the prerequisite for the united states to militarily withdraw from kosovo is the agreement of european countries to fill the vacuum left by us forces , but persuading the european allies to help clear up the messy situation is easier said than done .
the united states should really think things over now that it could not extricate itself from the kosovo quagmire .
the five groups participating in the election will unavoidably aim the crux of the election race at the question of cross - strait transport links and regard this as a profitable policy in terms of winning votes .
taiwan 's chang jung aviation , which is closely following china airlines in establishing an office in beijing , will also soon establish an office in shanghai .
in order to respond to the vast business opportunities in the future when there are direct cross - strait flights , taiwan 's fu hsing aviation has spent a huge sum on buying medium and long - range versions of the european airbus .
taiwan 's far east aviation has sent staff to the mainland to learn the technical aviation terms which differ from those used in taiwan , so as to complete all the prearrangement work before direct flights commence .
it is learned that all these four airline companies have stated that they will send aircraft to the mainland as soon as the taiwan authorities announce direct flights .
as for sea transport , all shipping companies hold that direct routes represent the inevitable trend , and it is absolutely impossible to ignore the important status and impact of the mainland 's vast market in asia .
in the past few years , though cross - strait relations have gone through twists and turns as well as storms , tremendous changes have also taken place in this regard .
all this eloquently proves that the desire of the chinese people to realize the reunification of the motherland is an irresistible historical trend .
hong kong and macao have successively returned to the motherland , and the historic task of striving to settle the taiwan issue and realizing the reunification of the motherland at an early date is now ever more prominently placed before us .
hong kong and macao have returned to the motherland one after the other , and the influence produced by the practice of " one country , two systems " has been continuously increasing .
now more and more people favor " one country , two system " ; since it has successfully solved the hong kong and macao questions , it can certainly apply to settle the taiwan issue .
of course , compared with the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the process of applying " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " to taiwan will be more complicated .
in fact , realizing the ultimate reunification of the country according to the principle of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " will not impose exactly the same pattern of " one country , two systems " for hong kong and macao on taiwan .
the content of settling the taiwan issue and achieving peaceful reunification according to the principle of " one country , two systems " will be more relaxed than that for hong kong and macao .
" peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " means seeking a plan acceptable to both sides of the strait through benign interaction and by seeking common ground while reserving differences .
after reunification , the two sides of the strait will coexist peacefully , and " no one will swallow the other . "
to bring about such a " double - or multiple - win " situation , the most feasible pattern is " one country , two systems . "
( 2 ) the course of reunification : the objective of reunifying the motherland can be achieved step by step .
( 3 ) compared with hong kong and macao , taiwan may retain its armed forces and personages from taiwan may serve as state leaders after its reunification with the mainland .
after the reunification , compatriots on both sides of the strait will be able to enjoy the dignity and honor of the country together .
since li denghui ( lee teng - hui ) dished out his " two - state " theory , the chinese government and people have waged a resolute struggle against it in order to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the " two - state " theory has also been rebuffed everywhere in the international community .
the fact that the principle of one china has been widely accepted by the international community shows that the " two - state " theory is but a lost move by the taiwan separatist forces as a result of their misappraisal of the situation .
the vital interests , major principles , and great justice of the chinese nation require the reunification of the motherland .
it should be particularly pointed out here that the principle of one china is the most important basis of cross - strait relations .
when the principle of one china is observed , there will be an opportunity for the development and improvement of cross - strait relations ; otherwise , cross - strait relations will be bound to come to a halt or even retrograde .
( 2 ) to prevent " taiwan independence " and interference by foreign forces , we must effectively make preparations for safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country .
dr. sun yat - sen once said : " reunification is the desire of all our nationals .
when the country is reunified , the people can enjoy a happy life ; otherwise , the people will suffer . "
peaceful reunification accords with the fundamental interests of the people .
only by settling the taiwan issue according to the principle of " one country , two system , " will it be possible to seek the common denomination to the maximum of the interests of both sides of the strait .
of course , peaceful reunification cannot be accomplished at one stroke , and the fulfillment of the ultimate objective may include the following stages and measures : ( 1 ) any questions can be discussed during the political negotiations under the premise of one china .
as the first step , the two sides of the strait may first conduct negotiations on the formal end of hostilities .
( 3 ) increasing mutual trust : the chinese people on both sides of the strait are of the same origin , and there is no fundamental conflict of interest between them that cannot be resolved .
but the " two - state " theory is a stumbling block to the development of cross - strait relations .
whether or not the deadlock between the two sides of the strait can be broken depends on the attitude of the taiwan authorities .
the taiwan issue cannot delay indefinitely .
after the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the chinese nation will certainly be able to usher in a glorious , historical moment of complete reunification of the motherland .
british and us media recently have published many lengthy reports and analysis on russian acting president putin .
most of the reports are replete with skepticism over this russian strongman .
the media of the west maintain that russia , under its new national security concept , has loosened its control of the conditions for using nuclear weapons , and has even clearly regarded the us - led western bloc as a " hostile force . "
the united states , however , did not respond in kind to dissolve the military bloc of nato on the basis of the " common values of all mankind . "
on the contrary , it took the opportunity to expand eastward in a big way . it even drew some former warsaw pact nations to its side to become its members . moreover , it even ruthlessly disintegrated the southern wing of russia through launching the kosovo war .
following the disintegration of the soviet union , the russian federation again faced the danger of yet another disintegration because of the " phenomenon of chechen , " which is a nation within a nation . "
now russia has become more soberly aware of its fundamental interests than ever before .
in the late 1990's , the so - called " common values of all mankind " which the west proclaimed evolved to become the theory that " human rights take precedence over sovereignty . "
two recent events taking places respectively in britain and the united states can fully explain what sort of the theory - - " human rights take precedence over sovereignty " - - it is when it is applied in actual practice .
the first one was britain 's release of chile 's former president , pinochet .
thus , extraditing pinochet to spain would be an extremely complex and sensitive international event , and britain , after considering the issue very carefully , dared not set this dangerous precedence .
the second incidence was : when chechen 's secessionist force was at the critical point where its very existence was at stake , and sought help , even military intervention , from the united states , the us government , while expressing profound sympathies , flatly rejected the request .
the us government has been strongly condemning russian troops for creating a " humanitarian crisis " in chechen .
if the united states chose to act according to the theory that " human rights take precedence over sovereignty , " then it should feel justify to send troops to chechen , just as it did when it invaded yugoslavia during the kosovo war .
but american people fully understand what will be the consequence of their intervention in the chechen war . they fully understand that it is not in the national interests of the united states .
many world events happening after cold war have vividly illustrated this fact , namely : although globalization has had a profound impact on the world , the core of international relations remains politics buttressed by strength and national interests .
while globalization has weakened the traditional national interests , it cannot replace the fundamental national interests .
this is because territory , resources , population , wealth , culture , institutions and other tangible and intangible things are still demarcated by ethnic and national lines .
the wealth of the united states belongs to the united states . the resources in china belong to china . british patents belong to britain .
national interests are still the basic principle that countries all over the world follow in making decisions or taking actions .
in the early winter morning , the great desert seemed sound asleep , and the whole area was in darkness as our cross - country jeep drove in .
after the lights were switched off , the jeep was like a small sandbag quietly waiting at a spot not far from the launching tower .
inside the jeep we were enjoying the darkness , because no one could find us .
of course , apart from myself , they were all on special security missions .
the date was 20 november 1999 , a day written in the glorious annals of the chinese nation .
at the time , however , we were anxiously waiting and worrying .
our vehicle was so close to the launching tower , and we could clearly see the long arms of the shiny green launching tower embracing a milk - white new type of rocket pointing at the sky .
all kinds of thoughts were thronging my mind at the time , but i did not say anything , i was afraid that the others in the vehicle were in a state of anxiety , for this after all was china 's first test - launch of a spaceship .
do not think for a moment that i , a female in the military , am stupidly brave , in fact i " know what 's what " and i am familiar with the veterans in charge of the spaceship 's destiny .
i just wanted to watch the " shenzhou " soar into the heaven from nearby ...
after the triumph , i can finally talk about it now .
wang yongzhi [ 3769 3057 1807 ] is the chief designer in china 's manned spaceflight project , and so far the missiles and carrier rockets designed under his charge have never failed .
it is no surprise that chief designer wang attracts young men .
i really admire chief designer wang 's powers of attraction .
i asked sun gongling , " why did you throw away the chance to get a professorship in the united states and chose instead to be chief designer wang 's technical assistant ? "
" things that chief designer wang has correctly identified can certainly be achieved , and they can be done in outstandingly successful fashion . "
sun gongling 's eyes were bright as he said this , as if he had already seen the spacecraft soaring into the sky .
he quickly added something worth pondering : " a man 's attraction lies in his wisdom and boldness . "
i agree with this .
qian xuesen , the father of china 's space effort , first recognized and favored wang yongzhi 's wisdom and boldness .
that was in june 1964 , when wang yongzhi went to the gobi for the first time to undertake the task of launching the first medium - short - range missiles developed by china itself .
during the test firing , the missile 's range was not long enough .
the experts considered how to add more propellant to the rocket , but as the rocket ' fuel tanks were limited , it was not possible to feed in any more .
just when everyone was racking their brains to think of a solution , a young lieutenant stood up and said : " if the propellant temperature is high when the rocket is launched , its density will be reduced , thus the motor 's throttle characteristic will change accordingly .
after calculation , if 600 kg of fuel are unloaded from the rocket , the missile will hit the target . "
everyone suddenly looked at the young man 's face .
the experts could hardly believe their ears .
someone said impolitely : " the rocket 's capacity was already insufficient , yet you want to remove some of the fuel ? "
they then took no notice of his suggestion .
wang yongzhi , however , was not reconciled to this ; he thought of qian xuesen , the technical director at the jiuquan launch site and a great scientist ; just before the launch , he plucked up his courage and went to qian xuesen 's house .
at the time qian xuesen was not very familiar with this " young fellow , " but after listening to his views , his eyes brightened and he joyfully exclaimed : " call the rocket 's chief designer here immediately . "
pointing at wang yongzhi , qian xuesen said to the chief designer : " this young man 's opinion is correct , and do as he says ! "
it turned out that the rocket 's range lengthened after some of the propellant was removed , and all the three missiles launched hit the target .
qian xuesen remembered wang yongzhi from that time .
when china started to develop its second - generation missiles , qian xuesen proposed : let the second - generation people be in charge of the second - generation strategic missiles , make wang yongzhi the chief designer .
the iron arms on the launch tower opened up , and the long rapier in the crystal palace , outlined against the sky , displayed its heroic posture .
i knew that it would be wang yongzhi controlling the rocket bundle 's " portrait rights . "
on 16 july 1990 when china successfully launched its first rocket bundle at xichang , he had been the chief person responsible for its development .
i concentrated my gaze on a tall and straight rocket ; it contained a great deal of new technology , such as that used for checking and dealing with faults , and it was completely reliable .
the manned spaceflight project has seven major subsystems , and each system has a chief designer and director .
i laughed : " good idea , i will tell him for you . "
that day i told wang yongzhi what liu zhusheng had said . gratified , chief wang smiled : " i know liu zhusheng , he is very careful . "
rocket director huang chunping [ 7806 2504 1627 ] said , however : there are over 300,000 parts of the rocket , and if just one of them goes wrong , it will affect the launch precision and may even cause failure .
it seemed that the alarm bell needed to ring for a long time .
at this time the launch tower was completely opened up , and the rocket and spacecraft were all displayed before our eyes .
what people worried about was the spacecraft atop the rocket .
curious , i asked : " why ? "
director qi bluntly said : " in the past i did not agree that the first new rocket should carry a spacecraft , moreover this is a prototype and a joint training in space hardware , but now i am more and more confident . "
the three - cabin scheme for the spacecraft was proposed by wang yongzhi .
what should be done about the new carrier rocket ?
there were different opinions on this .
the spaceflight departments proposed : the risk of sending up a prototype spacecraft is too great , and we should have a good match to be on the safe side .
shen rongjun held that since they had already undertaken to the cpc central committee to " strive for 1998 and ensure 1999 , " they must be credible , and they could send up the spacecraft in 1999 in accordance with the demands of the proper technology .
it all depends on human effort , and china must take a good first step in manned spaceflight .
wang yongzhi went to consult shen rongjun [ 3088 2837 7486 ] : " we should attach a spacecraft to the rocket , but what happens if progress on the spacecraft 's motor lags behind ? "
shen rongjun immediately flew to shanghai and went personally to the shanghai space technology research academy , which was developing the spacecraft 's motor , to find out what was going on .
the scheme was then submitted to a joint meeting of the " two chiefs " ( the chief director and the chief designer ) , and a consensus was reached and a decision made under the auspices of minister cao gangchuan .
in the affairs of men , it always happens that a correct choice will determine your success .
and for lieutenant general shen rongjun , deputy director of china 's manned spaceflight , the pressure was very heavy , because he strongly advocated that the first launch of the spacecraft must go into space and successfully return .
his decisionmaking choice was related to whether this undertaking would succeed or fail , and he profoundly felt the great difficulty of his task .
china 's first spacecraft was given the same " shenzhou " by president jiang zemin personally .
this china 's first spacecraft launch .
minister cao gangchuan and political commissar li jinai know their subordinates sufficiently well to delegate appropriate responsibilities to them ; they handed to shen rongjun the heavy task of the manned spaceflight and let him take overall responsibility .
he is a renowned spaceflight observation and control expert and also a launch controller of great experience .
this means that he shoulders heavy burdens .
for him , every launch is a test .
but he is a a tough fellow who displays not the slightest ambivalence in the face of risks ; his sole pursuit is to make the correct choice based on the state 's interests .
on 4 october shen rongjun was told in a urgent phone call from the launch site that there was a problem with a part of the spacecraft 's control system .
the following day he flew to the launch site and immediately convened a technical discussion meeting on whether to open up the craft to carry out crash repairs .
there were two diametrically opposed views : some held that the reentry cabin was sealed , and to open it up to look for the fault could result in new problems .
others held that dismantling the cabin ran the risk of a mistake in work on the ground , but if it was not dismantled , although there were reserve measures , they would be running the risk of a failure in space .
shen rongjun resolutely decided : " we cannot run the risk in space !
so long as the organization is tight , and the measures effective , mistakes on the ground can be avoided . "
the cabin was completely opened up ; in addition to solving the problem of the abnormal working of the part concerned , they also discovered and solved other problems .
in the end everyone sighed with relief .
i looked toward the launch tower ; the tip of the spacecraft atop the rocket glinted in the dark desert as it moved away from the tower . 13 november , the spacecraft arrives at the launch site .
i traveled to the launch site in site commander major general liu mingshan 's [ 0491 2494 1472 ] car .
the road was lined with tall xinjiang poplars standing up fine , straight , and sturdy in the desert , like sentinels guarding a narrow path . they gave people a feeling of exhilaration .
commander liu was full of emotion as he talked about the space city in the gobi , and even the 180,000 xinjiang poplars were full of vitality .
two days previously , i and he had passed neat rows of hot houses covering 150 mu , where cucumbers , tomatoes , peppers and other seasonal vegetables were growing sturdily .
commander liu said proudly : " we not only need to keep people here for the undertaking , but must also create a good environment for them to stay . "
the car stopped in front of a large construction ; the spacecraft was just being transported in the sun to the rocket general assembly and testing plant . we followed behind and entered a brain city .
apart from the towering rocket , there were many machine shops and equipment of all types .
liu mingshan is a good talker ; after graduating from university he left for the gobi , and now he has been there 33 years and has witnessed the launch of 33 satellites from the space city plus various types of missiles and carrier rockets .
he has a lot to say about " everyone else , " and he even told me that 100 percent of graduates from the space city school go on to higher education , but he did not say a work about his own family .
i was surprised at this .
i took the liberty to ask : " does your wife work here ? "
" no , she has departed .
i remember her with gratitude to the end of my life ! "
at this moment , the winter sunlight was on his face , and i could see tears in his eyes .
" that is the way with life , she just departed . "
he suddenly reproached himself : " she cried out several times that she had stomach pain , why did i not get her to the hospital sooner ? "
i had a string of questions to ask , but i could not touch on his hurt again .
seeing what i was thinking , he said quietly : " renjin had stomach cancer .
i can never forget her lying on the sick bed , exhorting me with her last breath : you must get the spacecraft into space . "
that afternoon i went into the space city history museum ; a photograph of liu mingshan 's wife pan renjin was on an honor board ; a senior colonel , she was smiling , and she appeared young and very pretty .
she was an outstanding technical cadre standard - bearer here , and also an outstanding party member , who had won many awards .
her main work here was to monitor the site 's electromagnetic compatibility .
a woman suffering from serious illness who knew her fate climbed up and down the several score meter - high testing plant , so tired that when she came off shift she could not climb into a vehicle .
because liu mingshan was busy with work , he failed to notice his wife 's condition .
she went to beijing for a meeting ; she made a speech there in the morning , and was taken to hospital in the afternoon .
liu remembers that tragic day : 18 april 1999 .
in accordance with pan renjin 's will , her ashes were buried in the dongfeng martyrs mausoleum .
this mausoleum contains 604 people from the gobi who rest in peace now ; through the desert haze , they could see the motherland 's rockets and satellites soaring into space and could hear the roar as the rockets rise from the launch site .
the desert wind blowing outside the mausoleum brings the rockets ' thunder past the neat rows of memorials , and there is peace after the wind has passed ; it is as peaceful as dreamland .
on the two rest days of the week , when things are quietest , liu mingshan brings flowers and stands alone before his wife 's memorial .
in a man 's life there is a kind of constant remembrance of gratitude , there is one thought that endures for ever , and there is a kind of person who walks alone .
liu mingshan is now alone , he shoulders the important commission of the motherland and people to achieve the hope his wife voiced with the dying breath - - to launch the " shenzhou ! "
three red flares soared into the sky , and the launch countdown began .
i have come over from the hustle of the launching site , and many times i have seen lieutenant general shen rongjun and lieutenant general hu shixiang [ 5170 0013 4382 ] , who is now deputy director of the installation department , directing satellite launches .
this is so tense that it would stop the heart of anyone there with heart disease .
however , they have the posture of generals , and they can disguise their feelings and pull through , until the launch has succeeded .
dawn is just breaking over the launch site , and i am happy to see the rocket pointing at the sky ; " good weather , favorable terrain , and friendly people " are all present , and probably nothing frightening will happen .
shen rongjun and hu shixiang exchanged views , then gave the decisive order : " launch according to plan .
better that ' no. 4 ' does not monitor , but security must be ensured . "
they swiftly relayed this from the launch site to the command center .
appearing before leading comrades of the state council and central military commission , although they felt great psychological pressure , they had tempered their cool and stubborn disposition during many complex and dangerous launches , and become composite commanders full of self - confidence .
at 0630 , the great desert trembled , the firmament shook , and orange flames lifted the rocket and the spacecraft with thunderous roar into the sky and into space .
below the launching tower ablaze with light , i bumped into major general zhang jianqi [ 1728 1696 0796 ] , deputy commander of the launch site .
he is bold and careful ; he stayed at the launch site during the launch .
in his view , manned spaceflight is a life project .
in 1997 , the day after completing the task of astronaut selection , he received an order to enter the jiuquan satellite launch center .
he told me : " any small mistake now will affect the safety of the astronauts ' lives . "
on 13 november , i witnessed a huge iron hook installing the spacecraft onto the rocket nose , over 90 meters high !
the spacecraft had already been fuelled .
tense , my hands were sweating .
but when i turned to look at zhang jianqi , who was directing the operation , he appeared completely calm .
i suddenly thought , he has demanded that the operators repeatedly train their hand and eye skills , until the big crane can insert the welding rod first time into the aperture which only has the diameter of a 2 cm beer bottle top .
if they are as skilled as that , what is there to worry about ?
is there not a saying : the skilled are bold ?
i also saw here xu kejun [ 1776 0344 0193 ] , chief engineer at the launch site .
the article he wrote entitled " china 's future launch sites should have two big technological progress features , " which was published in zairen hangtian [ manned spaceflight ] magazine in 1995 , was praised by china 's famous scientist qian xuesen .
one is 30 years older than the other .
chief designer qi said to yuan jiajun [ 5913 1367 6511 : " i took part in developing china 's first satellite when i was 30 , and you are taking part in directing the development of china 's first spacecraft at the age of 37 . "
chief designer qi faren was giving yuan jiajun a chance to display his talent .
chief qi said : " i hope that there will be successors in china 's space flight , with each generation getting stronger . "
i asked yuan jiajun : " do you know why the leadership chose you ? "
he readily replied : " i have a clear idea of the technical plans and have considered them quite carefully .
i will not only fulfill on time the task assigned me by the leadership but will ensure that it exceeds the leadership 's expectations . "
from the most tense stage in developing the spacecraft up to the launch , every saturday morning for 68 successive weeks yuan helped director qi in presiding over the weekend management meeting ; these meetings coordinated the solutions to over 3,000 problems .
the evening before the launch , yuan and the flight control group discussed things till 0400 in the morning ; they prepared 64 contingency plans for the craft , and although these were not used , they thought of everything .
it is precisely all this , it is precisely the selfless contributions of those named and unnamed heroes that ensured the complete success of the flight of " shenzhou . "
in the last 20 years , china 's science and technology research has made achievements which have gained the attention of the people of the world .
however , many scientists and editors have come to feel even more that the development of china 's science and technology magazines has fallen far behind the development of china 's science and technology itself .
china 's science and technology publishers have borne the dual pressures of a surplus number of science and technology magazines and an excessive emphasis on foreign appraisal systems .
in recent years , some domestic departments in charge of scientific research have shown a notably excessive emphasis on evaluating in terms of how many articles are published abroad .
the evaluation of scientific research personnel by many scientific research departments has frequently indiscriminately considered the publishing of one article abroad as equal to publishing one or more articles domestically , resulting to a great degree in attracting chinese academic articles to publishing abroad .
this means that in a period of 15 years , the number of articles published in scientific and technical periodicals domestically in china fell relatively by 26.2 percent .
the overemphasis on publishing abroad is not only divergent from objective reality , but also is not advantageous to the development of china 's scientific and technical journals .
the reason we believe that the development of domestic science and technical magazines is extremely important is that , as a window for revealing scientific research results , science and technical periodicals play the dual roles of simultaneous exchange and promoting technological development .
if china 's high - level scientific research results are for the most part published in foreign science and technical journals , due to the factors of cost and channels of distribution , it will be difficult to see that these results receive simultaneous first reporting domestically .
in addition , the national commission for natural sciences funding and the chinese science association have begun a joint provision of set amounts of funding to 100 outstanding science and technical periodicals . this definitely will promote the further heightening of the quality of these magazines .
in regard to increasing the exposure of publications , the investment into china 's science and technical publications has been by far insufficient .
at present , many foreign academic journals , because they have established specialized web pages on the internet , not only have provided weekly content for articles to be published , but some have even set up links to vast information databases .
these methods undoubtedly will expand the influence of the publications as well as the frequency with which the articles in the publications are quoted . at the same time , these methods will also increase subscribers .
in these respects , china 's domestic publications at present include only a minute number of scientific and technical journals , which are in an initial stage of development and await strengthening .
china 's scientific and technical journals should additionally fully pay attention to publicity and distribution work .
at present , china 's majority of english editions of scientific and technical publications have only some tens of editions that are subscribed to by foreigners , and even these few are not sufficiently marketed in foreign distribution channels .
if china 's english - edition scientific and technical publications unite together and seek suitable , highly efficient partners abroad , they might find in the near term some fairly feasible and effective foreign avenues of distribution .
[ cai tongchen ] the new term " clintonism " has appeared on the international scene since the gulf war .
what is clintonism , and what does it involve ? [ jin yinan ] since monroe was elected president in 1817 , many us presidents have given their name to a " doctrine . "
for instance there was the monroe doctrine that " america is america for americans , " the roosevelt doctrine of carrot and stick , the truman doctrine of organizing the cold war and encirclement , the nixon doctrine of narrowing the depth of intervention , and so on .
the new doctrine of " clintonism " has emerged since the gulf war and the breakup of the soviet union .
there is no accurate definition of clintonism .
clinton is the first us president in half a century to have done no military service .
now in the eighth year of his presidency , he has become the president who has issued the greatest number of air strike orders in history .
under his command , the combat operations of the us air force have increased by 400 percent over the cold war .
clinton himself is not only termed the " air strike president " by public opinion ; his diplomacy is also described as " air strike diplomacy " in western diplomatic circles .
what she said when sounding off against joint chiefs of staff chairman powell in 1993 has already become a famous saying in us political circles : " you are always talking about our super military forces !
but what is the point of having these forces if we cannot use them ? "
the fiery albright gave the true essence of clintonism : " use these forces , " so that the world will know " the point of possessing them . "
this then is the post - cold war world in us eyes .
since only one of the two poles remains , they must certainly seize the opportunity to make full use of this pole .
clintonism is military hegemonism in a unipolar world , which takes us interventionist policy to the limits .
from the middle east to the balkans , from somalia to afghanistan , there seems to be no day when it is not intervening in others ' affairs , and no year when it is not waging war to interfere in others ' affairs .
in the course of its interventions , it has even created for the united states a new method of war : " war without engagement . "
its main aim is to take advantage of its air and technological superiority over the enemy and use hi - tech weapons from the air and sea to do tremendous damage to the enemy without coming into direct contact with the enemy 's combat personnel .
the unga of september 1999 became a watershed in explaining clintonism .
at the unga , western opinion universally held that the united states would give a comprehensive exposition of clintonism , which was very much in the limelight .
a previous new york times article said that this was the most glorious move in us balkan policy in over 10 years , and that armed force was the only language that the balkans understand .
germany 's stern pictorial also said with irrepressible zest that nato had reached the turning point in developing from a defensive alliance into an offensive organization .
clinton 's address to the unga on 21 september , however , greatly disappointed these people .
clinton said : " we cannot intervene everywhere in everything , " and " military intervention is not always appropriate ; there are times when political and economic pressure are more effective . "
this low - key address caused sparse applause among the delegates , in sharp contrast to his address in 1998 , which was followed by a standing ovation .
what happened to this person who took us military intervention policy to the limit ?
it was precisely in the kosovo war , the peak of this military intervention , that clinton looked on helplessly at the inability of his doctrine to equal his ambition .
to attack a yugoslavia that had already been split up , the united states committed nearly one - third of its air strength , and its stock of air - launched cruise missiles was almost exhausted .
since production of combat planes such as the f-16 has ended , there was a serious shortage of parts for round - the - clock bombing , and there was no alternative but to cannibalize aircraft of this type in the united states as an emergency replenishment .
a shortage of flight personnel meant that they had to fly when already tired , and it was also necessary to urgently mobilize the reserve at home .
a us air force memorandum said : " the combat units are in a difficult period , there are almost no spare engines available , and the combat equipment is almost exhausted . "
air refuelling planes , electronic warfare planes , and ground attack planes that were being used by the us central military command against iraq , and aircraft carriers used by the pacific command to cruise the western pacific , were transferred to help in the action .
during the " missile crisis " on the korean peninsula , the americans acted contrary to their moves in the middle east and europe by seeking in various ways engagement and negotiations with north korea , in a bid for a compromise .
when li teng - hui dished up the " two - state theory , " he expected the americans to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him , but they resented the retainer turning into the master .
bader , former director of asian affairs in the national security council , said : " we have not undertaken not to stint the blood of american soldiers . "
when will the us military , which is accustomed to using retainers , personally fight in the vanguard on behalf of a retainer ?
this is the objective reason why clintonism can hardly be swayed by people like li teng - hui in asia .
its caution and restraint in asia are also based on the following objective factors : first of all , there is no organization like nato in asia .
although there is the us - japan security treaty , and the 100,000 troops under the us pacific command , it is extremely difficult for the united states to squeeze the countries of the region together and place them under its standard .
second , it is difficult to find an opponent and theater in asia where a war could be completed " swiftly " and " without getting in deep . "
the peoples nurtured by history , nationality , and culture in asia , however , are completely the opposite of the standard opponents imagined by the united states .
third , the greatest obstacle encountered by clintonism in asia is precedent when , far from achieving successful intervention , the united states has encountered serious failure in this region since world war ii .
for americans , military policy directed at asia has consistently been the most difficult to design .
here it is not so much the " victories " in the gulf and kosovo wars as rather the lessons of the korean and vietnam wars that play the role of historical experience .
as a result , the americans are unable to apply the iraq or kosovo pattern to resolve the problems of this region .
a number of countries with highly developed information technology [ it ] have emerged since the 1980's , in the wake of the asymmetrical development of the world information field .
they exploit their monopoly status in information resources and the related industries to impose it control , penetrate by means of information resources , and dump information products in countries where it is relatively undeveloped , so as to attain their corresponding political , economic , and military goals .
this is the " information colonialism " phenomenon which this article raises .
the high development of it , and the full exploitation of information resources and the expansion of their volume have caused explosive growth in the amount of information in the world .
the total volume in 1995 was 2,400 times that of 1985 , and the volume available every day now is 6.5 times that in the whole of 1985 .
handling , storing , disseminating , and using the ever - growing information resources has become an urgent problem in the world today .
political stability , economic growth , and social development depend to a very great extent on the production , dissemination , and application of information .
it is exported like capital , as an intellectual property right ; the information business has become a new growth point ; and in addition the development of the information industry is unbalanced - - these provide a hotbed for information colonizing .
according to relevant data , in the global information business , the united states accounts for 92 percent of cpu output and 86 percent of systems and parts , and there are now 113 million internet customers .
there are nearly 3,000 large databanks in the world , 70 percent of which are in the united states ; it can be said that they control most of the markets throughout the world .
in this regard , the french complained back in the 1970's : the entire french databank field is monopolized by the united states ; and in the 1980's , japan exclaimed : japan may be reduced to the status of america 's " information colony . "
for a long time now , international political activities and national and regional political activities have been limited within a certain scope , due to the impact of the volume of information disseminated and the speed of dissemination .
the economy is the foundation on which a state and nation depends for its existence .
forty percent of the source of modern economic development and growth comes from the information industry .
output value of information industries of many developed western countries accounts for 45 to 60 percent of their gnp , whereas in the developing countries the proportion is only about one percent , the scope is narrow , and the quality is poor .
thus , powerful information countries switch from exporting financial capital to exporting information capital and imposingly occupy the information field in backward countries , thus restricting the development of national information business there .
at the same time they pose a serious threat to the economic security of these countries .
the progress of it has also sparked changes in the world military scene .
just after " windows 95 " appeared , the australian navy discovered that this software has a mysterious " black box , " and once on the internet , it would quietly send mechanical information to the software headquarters .
and when a " windows 98 " customer registers on the internet , the system will automatically collect the information in the customer 's computer , even personal distinguishing data .
it is also connected to a vast databank which collects information on customers , and when required , this databank can provide the customer 's secrets to political , economic , and military organizations .
all this warns us that these spies on the net are more fearful than the " beauty snake . "
culture is an important foundation in preserving social stability .
the people of a given nation in a given age are living in a certain cultural pattern and cultivate their own human qualities .
norms of language , writing , beliefs , and morals have formed the cultural circle of each country and nation .
as the information net develops , countries importing information suffer powerful cultural blows .
this cannot but arouse concern .
in the information age , information has become a major strategic resource , the information industry has become a country 's mainstay industry , information security has become the most important security element , and the information net has become a country 's important strategic infrastructure .
the developed countries have unfolded fierce competition in research and development , centering around " technological hegemony . "
the phenomenon of information colonialism will become an important motive cause in future war .
anyone who does not have information independence and sovereignty will not have true national independence and sovereignty .
without information security , there can be no national political , economic , and military security .
when mankind entered the industrial age , the chinese nation had its fill of the bitterness of colonialism and semi - colonialism , and such a state of affairs cannot be restaged when mankind enters the information age .
we must therefore have full rational awareness and strategic countermeasures .
chairman jiang has pointed out : " innovation is the soul of a nation 's progress and an inexhaustible motive force for the prosperity and development of a country . "
we should innovate and develop our national information industry , especially the research and development of chips and operational systems , so that china can stand tall amid the world information industry .
we should establish the concept of standing on our own feet .
those who become masters are not subject to control by others ; we should fully exploit the global information network to strengthen the impact of china 's information and open up our information space .
at the same time we should build our own backbone state political , military , and economic information network .
we must establish self - defense measures .
with regard to fire walls , circuit devices [ lu you qi , 6424 3945 0892 ] , website security devices and other information security items , we should as far as possible not import them if we have them in china .
hong kong , 10 february (zts) - - since the enforcement of the patent law in 1985 , china 's patent industry has developed rapidly out of nothing .
on 11 january of this year , the number of patent applications across china topped the 1 - million mark , and thus china has entered the world 's rank of big powers of patent applications .
china 's patent industry has made considerable progress in such areas as patent legislation , patent protection , and training and international exchanges in patent qualified people in a short span of 15 years .
particularly in the last two years , as china 's market economic reform progresses , the number of patent applications at home and abroad has increased by a wide margin .
according to a briefing by a relevant responsible person from the state intellectual property rights bureau , the number of patent applications china handled in 1998 and 1999 totaled 121,989 and 134,240 or an increase of 6.8 percent and 10 percent respectively from the previous year .
of the country 's total patent applications , the number of patent applications by scientific research units and institutions of higher learning increased by 7 percent and 22 percent respectively , while that of patent applications by enterprises at home also increased by 6.7 percent and 20 percent respectively .
the vigorous development of the patent industry will play a greater role in china 's future economic development .
an expert from the state intellectual property rights bureau stated : having superiority in patents is an important guarantee for gaining the initiative in competition .
strengthening patent work is an important measure to carry out strategic readjustment of the chinese economic structure .
achieving a leap in technological development is an important target of china 's scientific and technological progress and technological innovation and also the only way to expedite china 's modernization .
state intellectual property rights office director jiang ying also pointed out : it will help vigorously push technological innovation activities among enterprises , scientific research units , and institutions of higher learning to carry out patent work throughout the entire process of technological innovation .
although china has achieved marked results in its patent industry over the last 15 years , its patents are comparatively limited in terms of technology , quality , and size .
first , the fundamental reason for china 's limited patent size lies in its source .
the number of high - quality inventions , that is , inventions that can bring about relatively high benefits , is too limited .
this being the case , the key to solving the problem of patent quantity lies in improving the scientific and technological level as a whole on which china relies for its patents .
otherwise , in a situation in which the number of research achievements to be patented is limited ; their quality is poor , and their capability to generate profits is limited , problems that can be solved are always limited even though patent conceptions are so well popularized .
second , efforts should be made to solve the problems of improving the quality and efficiency of patent work , lowering the cost of patent applications , and shortening the period of applying patents for inventions .
third , the actual protection of intellectual property rights should be enhanced .
to spark the desire of scientists and technicians for innovations , it is very important to implement a paten - rewarding mechanism . this will help form a benign circle in technological innovation activities among enterprises .
the institute issued a total of 300,000 yuan in awards for patent applicants from 1995 to 1998 .
every time after their patent were implemented , patent holders would have the right to acquire the payment for the implementation of their patented technology .
the payment will be issued cumulatively to patent holders at a rate of between 1.2 percent to 2 percent of the actual profits generated by the technology or products formed through the implementation of their patented technology .
the publication and implementation of these numerous policies has thus powerfully mobilized the enthusiasm of the institute 's scientific research personnel for innovations . as china 's entry into the world trade organization is approaching , patent departments in china are facing greater pressures .
therefore , it is all the more necessary to enhance the quality and international competitiveness of patent work , further safeguard national sovereignty and economic security , and promote social progress .
why is it that the daya bay nuclear power station can be ranked among the best nuclear power plants in the world ?
establish the modern enterprise system and successfully probe the way of scientific management of enterprises in which the state has a controlling interest .
the two 1 million kilowatt - class nuclear power generating units of the daya bay nuclear power station are like two " money printing machines " operating around the clock , each of which creates more than $ 1 million in output value every day .
the daya bay nuclear power station earned $ 560 million in foreign exchange and created 2.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes in 1999 .
with such an enormous amount of profits , is the daya bay power station very lavish in spending ?
when briefed by staff of the daya bay power station , the reporters found that the briefing materials they used were printed on both sides while those distributed to us were printed on one side only .
to feed our curiosity , they explained that printing on both sides of the paper of materials for internal use was to reduce cost , and printing on one side of the paper of materials for external use was to show respect to their guests .
the sense of cost and the extent of meticulous management of the staff of the daya bay power station can be seen from this !
the official name of the daya bay nuclear power station is guangdong nuclear power joint venture company , of which 75 percent of the stocks are owned by the state and the remaining 25 percent by hong kong china electric power company .
most authoritative in the joint venture company is not its president but its rules , systems , and procedures .
the joint venture company has strict rules , systems , and execution procedures for all its work , from the procurement of staple materials and the suspension , reloading , and overhaul of nuclear power generating units to the distribution of labor insurance goods and small gifts to guests .
if not permitted by systems and procedures , even its president cannot use a penny or any material .
degai [ name as transliterated ] , a foreign expert who had worked in the daya bay power station , said that in a certain sense , what the power station produced was not electricity but documents , because everything had rules to follow and was restricted by procedures .
implementation of rules , systems , and work procedures hinges on man .
to prevent and correct the practice of abusing power to violate systems and procedures , the daya bay power station has learned from advanced enterprise management expertise from abroad and established an auditing department directly responsible to its board of directors .
the influence of the auditing department can be seen everywhere in the daya bay power station .
more than 300 tonnes of substandard concrete iron placed on the work site of the lingao nuclear power station were not transported out . the auditing department issued a notice of correction as soon as it discovered this .
a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts , a protective screen more secure than steel - reinforced concrete nuclear power is a clean and highly efficient source of energy .
however , 100 percent safety should be ensured .
it has established a virtual protective screen more secure than steel reinforced concrete - - a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts .
the daya bay nuclear power station has a clear regulation which permits errors in work but not lies to cover up the errors , because lies will lead to still greater mishaps or hidden dangers .
on one occasion , leakage of lubricant was discovered on a gas turbine after a grade - seven maintenance worker completed the overhaul of its filter screen .
an inspection showed that an insertion ring was missing .
the worker said that he did not receive the insertion ring , but the power station 's strict system of registration of material inflow and outflow proved the worker was lying .
sensing the seriousness of the problem , the worker admitted that he dropped the insertion ring into the filter screen out of carelessness .
the maintenance department immediately organized personnel to conduct analysis and study and adopted timely measures to eliminate the hidden danger .
since then , an atmosphere has been established in the power station in which people begin with speaking the truth when they want to correct an error .
it is in such detailed workflow , strict rules and systems , and the sense of safety deeply rooted in workers ' hearts that the nuclear safety culture of the daya bay nuclear power station is reflected .
outside the main control room of the no. 1 generating unit , the reporters saw some banners , reading " do everything successfully at one stroke , make every person a protective screen " and " it is safety not the market that decides everything . "
the nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts has laid a solid foundation for the safe operation of the daya bay nuclear power station .
in 1999 , the number of unplanned suspensions of operation of the two nuclear reactors and power generating units at the power station was " 0 , " and all the major operation indicators of the power station reached the world 's advanced level .
using the nuclear power station to support nuclear power development and achieving continuous development , the daya bay nuclear power station has become the incubator of guangdong 's nuclear power development .
" using nuclear power stations to support nuclear power development and achieving continuous development " is a principle that central leading comrades formulated for guangdong 's nuclear power development .
zan yunlong , the major planner and builder of the daya bay nuclear power station , was appointed chairman of the board of directors and concurrently president of the guangdong nuclear power group company .
by then , the building projects of the lingao nuclear power station had been successfully completed , and the main part of the project entered the period of installation .
the return of macao to the motherland last year was a major event of the chinese nation . the national cppcc committee successfully organized and positively participated in a series of activities marking the handover of macao .
as related , the hong kong , macao , taiwan , and overseas chinese committee under the national cppcc committee last year designated the work towards taiwan as the priority of its work .
on the occasion marking the 4th anniversary of president jiang zemin 's important speech on the taiwan issue , the committee and the relevant central departments jointly held large - scale commemorative forums .
following that , they also held special study and discussion meetings to further study president jiang 's important speech and the relevant central policies on taiwan issue . some committee members talked freely about their experience in attending the cross - strait exchange .
while conducting questionnaire surveys in 30 provinces and cities , the committee members also sent special groups to suzhou and kunshan in jiangsu , and shenzhen and dongguan in guangdong , to conduct investigations and make reports .
they held forums with relevant responsible persons of seven ministries and commissions , including the state economic and trade commission , to discuss problems discovered in the course of investigation , and offered some suggestions for resolving relevant problems .
in addition , the committee also successively sent visiting groups to taiwan to conduct extensive contacts and exchanges with the taiwan business circles .
during their foreign visits , responsible persons of the committee and some committee members conducted extensive contacts with taiwan compatriots overseas and criticized lee teng - hui 's words and deeds of splitting the motherland along with the local chinese community .
many committee members also actively wrote and published articles and participated in activities to criticize the " two - state theory . "
at the time when the 50th national day and the cppcc anniversaries were celebrated , this committee also invited and received several hundreds of representatives of hong kong , macao , taiwan and overseas chinese compatriots to beijing to attend celebration activities .
since the early morning of 8 february , israeli jet fighters have continued to bomb lebanon .
the israeli government claimed that the places israel has raided are bases of the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas and the air raids have been a retaliatory act against hezbollah 's attacks of israel 's " security zone " in southern lebanon which caused injuries and deaths of several israeli soldiers .
however , reports from lebanon indicated that lebanon 's major power stations and some other civilian facilities were destroyed , dozens of civilians were injured during the bombings , and lebanon 's economy has suffered serious losses .
israel 's air raids have triggered anger and condemnations among all lebanese .
the lebanese government also submitted a petition letter to un secretary general annan asking the international community to stop israel from repeatedly invading lebanon .
the international community , especially the arab world , also has shown strong concern for israel 's bombings of lebanon 's civilian facilities , causing injuries of civilians , and has criticized one after another israel 's such " reckless invasion act " .
public opinion has widely held that , at the current critical moment when the middle east peace process is facing a trial , israel 's air raids not only have worsened its relations with lebanon , but also will jeopardize the entire middle east region 's peace process .
in 1985 , israel ended its invasive war with lebanon . but , citing need to ensure security in the northern part of its country , israel established in lebanon 's southern border area a " security zone " of more than 1,000 square km .
to oppose israel 's illegal occupation , the lebanese hezbollah has carried out an armed resistance struggle .
since the beginning of this year , fighting has continued to erupt in the " security zone , " and , over a short period of the last two weeks , six israeli soldiers were killed .
personnel casualties triggered a strong response in israel and voices asking troop withdrawal from the zone have become increasingly loud .
to lessen domestic pressures , the barak government chose retaliatory air raids in an attempt to reverse the situation .
but , things have turned out to be just the opposite . the bombings not only have not lowered tensions in southern lebanon ; on the contrary , they have deepened hostility between israel and lebanon .
on the night of 8 february , after israel carried out the first round of air raids in the early morning , hezbollah guerrillas claimed that they launched another assault against israel 's " security zone , " killing one israeli soldier and injuring two .
the air raids also have not done any good to israel 's northern border .
syria , as an ally of lebanon in opposing israel 's illegal occupation , has made particularly strong responses to israel 's air raids .
in december last year , with us mediation , syria and israel began to resume peace talks .
but , after two rounds of talks , because israel refused to make a commitment on delimiting israel - syria borderline based on the control line of june 1967 and on withdrawing all israeli troops from the golan height , syria refused to continue the peace talks .
now , when israel and syria are attacking and criticizing each other for being responsible for the deadlock of the peace talks , israel blatantly bombed lebanon .
this undoubtedly has worsened syrian - israeli relations , making the prospects of the peace talks , which already have been at a standstill , even dimmer .
what needs to be pointed out is that the lebanon issue is closely related to palestine - israel peace talks and the entire middle east peace process . therefore , obviously israel 's air raids of lebanon also will jeopardize palestine - israel peace talks .
the palestine issue is an important link in the regional peace process .
according to the " sharm el sheikh memorandum " reached between palestine and israel in september last year , the two sides will sign on 13 february this year a framework agreement on the final - status issue and will reach a permanent peace treaty in september this year .
however , over a period that just passed , talks between the two sides on the final - status issue have proceeded very slowly and little progress has been made , and currently they basically are in standstill .
after israel began the air raids , palestine immediately made a strong response , expressing indignation over israel 's arrogant act of ignoring the regional peace process .
it has been learned that , the united states , france , and other parties concerned have privately initiated diplomatic activities in an effort to prevent the situation in southern lebanon from getting out of control .
however , obviously it will be very difficult to push all parties concerned to the negotiation table while the armed conflict is going on .
the balance of rights and obligations is an important characteristic of the world trade organization [ wto ] .
upholding the balance of rights and obligations has been one of the three basic principles that china has consistently upheld during the 14 years of applying to rejoin gatt and join the wto .
viewing the basic functions of the wto , an important characteristic is the balance of rights and obligations ; between its different members , rights and obligations are mutual and are also basically balanced .
all wto accords and articles have been adopted by its members through negotiations and agreed on the basis of reaching unity through consultations .
any member must while enjoying the rights also undertake the corresponding obligations , so that rights and obligations are basically in balance .
the wto legal system is basically composed of basic principles and exceptions to these principles .
on the basis of abiding by the basic principles and carrying out their corresponding obligations , wto members can also , under the necessary conditions , make use of the exclusion clauses to protect their own rights and interests .
according to these clauses , when wto members encounter serious imbalance of international payments , or when economic development requires the government to adopt interventionist policies , and so on , they can temporarily readjust their corresponding obligations in order to ensure their economic stability and development .
the wto advocates promoting trade liberalization , but it is not a free trade organization , and any specific level and progress of lowering trade barriers and opening up markets must be determined through negotiations , in order to embody the balance of rights and obligations .
the wto demands that its members lower trade barriers so that trade can become more free , thus enabling the members to fully exploit their relative advantages and lead forward economic growth through trade development .
trade liberalization , however , has conditions ; the wto permits its members , especially the developing countries , to gradually achieve trade liberalization in line with their own economic and trade situation and competitiveness , to facilitate the provision of opportunities for their domestic industrial restructuring .
this has to a very great extent changed the situation in which major treading nations dominated dispute settlement , and gives a certain degree of protection to the interests of developing countries .
at present there are 135 members of the wto , and developing countries and regions account for 81 percent of membership .
the developing countries have also realized that only through participation and cooperation can they gradually change the irrational and unfair international economic order ; this is precisely one of the main reasons why many developing countries join the wto .
uphold balance between rights and obligations when china joins the wto beginning in 1986 , in its 14 - year negotiating process for rejoining gatt and joining the wto , china has consistently upheld the principle of balancing rights and obligations .
generally speaking , the obligations carried out should correspond to the rights enjoyed ; we will not accept a price that exceeds what we can bear , but must achieve balance of rights and obligations .
since the launch of reform and opening up , china 's all - round national strength has increased , and its impact on world economy and trade has continually expanded ; the wto is incomplete without china 's participation , nor does such a situation benefit world economic development .
it is precisely because of this that we have justification and ability to ensure the balance of rights and obligations in the negotiating process .
in the negotiations for china to rejoin gatt and join the wto , we have consistently upheld the principle that china is a developing country , and that we can only join the wto under the conditions for developing countries .
according to the relevant wto provisions , developing countries will in some respects enjoy differentials and favored treatment that are different from the developed countries .
for instance , during the transition period , taking information technology products as an example , developed countries need to lower their tariffs to zero by 2000 , while for developing countries the period can be extended until 2005 .
these transition periods are extremely important for easing the pressure on opening up markets and gaining time for readjustment and development .
thus the results of the negotiations will ultimately benefit china 's reform and opening up and help to preserve our economic security .
correctly understand the balance of rights , obligations when china joins the wto after china joins the wto , the rights we enjoy and the obligations we must undertake are one and the same .
china 's market potential has very great attraction for wto members .
china 's accession to the wto , its observance of wto rules , and its execution of the obligations on market opening which we have given in the negotiations will provide still better and still more stable opportunities for other countries and regions to gain entry into our market .
the field of investment in opening up to the world will further expand , foreign - funded enterprises will gradually enjoy national treatment , and the investment environment will become more relaxed , transparent , and stable .
this will undoubtedly bring still more returns for foreign investors .
in order to gain this right of opportunity to enter china 's market , wto members must also carry out their obligations regarding china , thus laying a stable foundation for long - term economic and trade development between china and other countries and regions .
regarding the question of the balance of rights and obligations in china 's accession to the wto , we must uphold dialectical materialism and look at it from the viewpoint of development ; rights and obligations are not immutable .
on the other hand , china 's economy is also developing rapidly , and our capacity to understand , adapt to , and sustain the opening of markets and international rules is also changing all the time .
since china has successfully carried out the policy of reform and opening up , and especially since the early 1990's , our all - round national and economic strength has markedly increased .
after china joins the wto , we must become familiar with and grasp its rules as quickly as possible , and change to the maximum the rights that we enjoy into actual interests for promoting our economic development .
at the same time , we must do a good job in handling the relationship between observing international rules and carrying out our international obligations on the one hand and ensuring national security and upholding economic stability on the other .
beijing , 13 feb (zxs) - - according to china 's ministry of agriculture , china 's top agricultural priority this year will be one of adjusting its agricultural structure .
agricultural minister chen yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for china to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .
he said the agricultural restructuring will be market - oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .
to succeed in adjusting the agricultural structure , chen yaobang said : first of all , we will adjust the farming structure .
with respect to regional layouts , coastal areas in the east and outskirts of large and medium cities will develop modern agriculture to produce export - oriented agricultural goods .
these areas will eventually become bases that export quality agricultural products .
areas in central china , to give play to their high productivity of food grain , will establish large , efficiently managed bases that produce commercial grain and process grain for feed and other purposes .
we will also develop the production of quality soybean in northeast china . second , we will promote animal husbandry and turn it into a large industry .
eastern china and the outskirts of large cities will actively develop production of scale .
they will also develop intensive processing of livestock products and speed up the pace of modernizing their animal husbandry .
to promote industrialization of animal husbandry , we will make efforts to improve the three major operations - - breeding good species , controlling epidemics , and producing animal feed .
third , we will continue to optimize the structure of fishing operations .
we will strictly control the their intensity and continue to enforce the " zero growth " plan .
fourth , we will give full scope to the role of agricultural machinery in adjusting the agricultural structure .
meanwhile , we will tighten the management of various trades with guidelines and speed up setting up the systems governing market information and agricultural standards .
bangkok , 13 feb - - the tenth united nations conference on trade and development [ unctad ] was convened on 12th february in bangkok , thailand .
at the meeting 's inaugural ceremony , people could not forget the unpleasant and fruitless minister - level wto meeting in seattle in the united states at the end of last year .
the result of that meeting fully demonstrated the heightened conflict between the developing and the developed countries in the ways they handled global economic affairs .
one of the main challenges facing the unctad today is how to deal with the issue of economic globalization .
the progress in science and technology and information technology has accelerated the global exchange of commodities , manpower , capital , talent , and markets ; this trend of economic globalization will prevail .
judging by today 's situation , economic globalization not only has accelerated global economic development but also has widened the gap between the rich and the poor worldwide .
according to a conference on trade and development publication , it will cost $ 6 billion to make sure everybody in the world receives the most basic education , but the american consumers spend that much each year on cosmetics alone .
even more shocking is the fact that it will only cost $ 13 billion to give everybody in the least developed countries the basic health care protection , while the united states and the european countries spend that much feeding their pets each year .
it is clear that as the world 's total wealth soars , the gap between the developed and the developing countries is also widening .
therefore in the course of economic globalization , it is essential to promptly set up a fair and reasonable new international economic order to remedy the defects brought by the globalization process .
development is another issue facing the conference on trade and development , and as far as the developing countries are concerned , development naturally is the number one issue .
if the developing countries fail to develop , there will be no peace or prosperity in the world .
today , the developing countries as a whole have become the source of world economic growth , but fund shortages , backward technologies , lack of qualified management personnel , poor infrastructure , and other problems are seriously hampering the developing countries ' economic growth .
the developed countries should tilt more toward the developing countries in terms of providing capital , transferring technologies , training more qualified people , and opening up their markets , so that the developing countries can reap more benefits from economic globalization .
this responsible person revealed that it is necessary to set the prices fixed by the government and the guide prices suggested by the government in a rational way this year so as to encourage residents to increase their consumption .
he pointed out : it is necessary to intensify the reform of prices and fees this year and let prices that are suitable for decontrolling be determined by the supply and demand in the marketplace in a timely manner .
though they are not in great numbers , they do have a major impact on the national economy .
this responsible person said : steps will be taken this year to set about studying how to reform the price formation mechanism in these industries .
for example , competitive grid entry prices will be introduced on an experimental basis in the power industry to restrain the construction investment and operating costs of power plants .
the reform of the rural electricity price control system and the transformation of the rural power grid will be accelerated , introducing the same price on the same grid for both urban and rural areas in phases and in batches .
the price formation mechanism for crude oil and finished oil products shall be perfected to encourage oil and petrochemical companies to engage in rational competition .
a mechanism of competition shall be introduced in telecommunications , railway , civil aviation , and urban public transport industries and a hearing system for pricing decisions established to restrain the costs of enterprises in these industries .
china 's civil aviation industry has achieved sustained , high - speed growth since the reform . however , the chinese civil aviation industry 's major indices are extremely low in proportion to the world totals .
china 's air market has a low degree of openness and its air industry is extremely lacking in international competitiveness . 3 .
china has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate . 4 .
in 1997 , proceeds from general aviation only accounted for 0.3 percent of the income of caac - affiliated enterprises .
the civil aviation industry is one of the emerging industries that are capital - and high - technology - intensive and have the greatest potential for development and is also one of the most important industries with a considerable spillover effect .
government administration remains integrated with enterprise management the civil aviation industry is one of the few industries in present - day china that still retain the planned economy 's characteristic of integrating government administration with enterprise management .
after having practiced semi - militarized management for a long period of time , it is having overlapping organizations and a large number of redundant personnel and there is an acute contradiction between its conventional , backward management system and the advanced , modern technology .
structural reform in civil aviation will have the direct effect of significantly increasing the flight and productive hours of aircraft and airport utilization rate without the purchase of new aircraft .
it is necessary to accelerate the transformation of civil aviation administrative departments ' functions .
civil aviation enterprises should be completely separated from the civil aviation administration and establish a modern enterprise system .
civil aviation prices are too high thanks to the accelerated pace in technological advancement , the worldwide revolution in transportation is prominently reflected in the significant decline in aviation costs and prices , constant improvements in the quality of service , and continuous decline in transportation time .
however , china has followed a trend contrary to the development of the world civil aviation industry which sees a constant rise in the unit cost of transportation that causes a corresponding rise in the unit price of transportation .
as the airfares rise further , the seat utilization rate would decline further , the unit cost of flight would rise further , and the amount of losses would expand further .
this is a " suicidal " pricing policy as well as the root of vicious market competitions .
first , it is necessary to make an early , rational division between military , civilian , and military - civilian joint controls of the air .
second , it is necessary to give priority to opening up the domestic air transportation market to promote the integration of the domestic air transportation market .
third , it is necessary to sell domestic air route rights by open auction to encourage competition and remove the monopoly and privileges of caac - affiliated enterprises .
fourth , it is necessary to encourage competitive civil aviation enterprises in the country to engage in strategic cooperation and alliance with transnational civil aviation companies .
in future , the government ( the caac in particular ) will no longer be the representative of the interests of the more than 100,000 civil aviation producers in the country and will shift its focus to protecting the interests of the vast number of consumers .
second , it is necessary to step up reform of state enterprises and on the whole put an end to enterprise deficits and turn deficits into profits .
third , it is necessary to step up the building of the legal system , earnestly rule the country by law , and resolutely correct and punish the practices and individuals involved in meddling in the legal system .
fourth , it is necessary to have a sense of timing and urgency in settling the question of taiwan , place the issue on the agenda , and resolutely attack and never yield to the separatists .
fifth , it is necessary to start the work of developing the west in an all - round way . we should offer support in policy , funds , and human resources . as this is strategic work , it should be carried out without delay .
sixth , we should go all out to attack the sects and sham science , which harm the state and the people . we should also crack down on the illegal organizations and confrontational forces that undermine the legal system and social order under various pretexts .
seventh , the focus of the anticorruption struggle will be the investigation of the party , government , and law enforcement departments in violating law in the economic and financial fields .
eighth , the provincial party and government leading bodies should undergo readjustment and reinforcement . in line with the required standards , it is necessary to strictly select and choose cadres and never practice favoritism .
viewed from the working plans , figures from beijing 's political circles believe that there will be new progress in this year 's anticorruption struggle .
the attack on sects will be equated with that on hostile forces , which means that china will not soften its measures towards the sects because of us hegemonist meddling .
more than a month ago , the chinese government resumed the exercise of its sovereignty over macao .
this is a great event of the chinese nation , which happened after hong kong 's return to the motherland , marking a new stage in the great cause of the reunification of the motherland .
the solving of the taiwan issue has been placed more prominently before us .
they urged the taiwan authorities to seize the opportunity and make bona fide response .
the number of taiwan compatriots who traveled to the mainland via macao by air exceeded 2 million . the compatriots coming and leaving the mainland via macao had exceeded 3 million .
the figure drastically increased from a few hundred thousand in 1994 to 1.05 million in 1999 , a 6 - fold increase .
the total volume of trade between macao and taiwan had gone up from $ 156 million in 1994 to over $ 300 million in 1999 .
the main line that runs through the speech of president jiang is the upholding of the principles of " peaceful reunification , and one country , two systems " .
the 8 - point proposal is the inheritance of these principles and planning in the new situation .
practice over the past five years shows that the " one country , two systems " is a historical choice and the best method and realistic road to the accomplishment of the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland .
the " one country , two systems " principle was first put forward for resolving the taiwan issue , but it was first put into practice in hong kong .
the vast numbers of hong kong residents and the international community have spoken highly of the implementation of " one country , two systems " in hong kong .
after hong kong 's homecoming , the chinese government has now resumed the exercise of sovereignty over macao .
the steady transition of macao and the smooth handover of power is another successful practice of the " one country , two systems " concept .
at present , the msar government headed by edmund ho hau wah is properly operating administration according to law .
macao compatriots , as masters of their own affairs , are taking an active part in social affairs , macao is full of vitality and has a bright future .
the principle of " one country , two systems " is applicable to hong kong and macao , as well as to taiwan .
hong kong and macao have many points in common with taiwan .
of course , the taiwan issue has its particularity aside from the questions of hong kong and macao .
the issues of hong kong and macao are historical questions that resulted from foreign colonialist aggression against and occupation of china .
the issues of hong kong and macao were resolved through the diplomatic means of negotiation .
the taiwan issue should be solved by conducting political negotiations and consultations between the two sides of the straits under the one china principle .
because there exist differences between the characteristics of taiwan and those of hong kong and macao , the concrete way to solve the taiwan issue by the method of " one country , two systems " can be more relaxed than that for hong kong and macao .
president jiang 's 8 - point proposal sincerely calls for conducting negotiations on peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait on the premise of the one china principle , on which any question can be discussed .
people of insight in taiwan should respond to president jiang 's proposal as soon as possible and carry out cross - strait dialog and negotiation .
since china could hold talks with the united kingdom and portugal and successfully resolve the questions of hong kong and macao , why can 't the fraternal brothers across the taiwan straits hold talks and seek a common understanding ?
now that direct exchanges of mail , trade , and air and shipping services have not been realized between the two sides of the strait , macao has served as one of the important bridges for cross - strait ties and exchanges .
it is very easy for taiwan visitors to come to macao and they may enter and stay in macao for 20 days without any visa .
thanks to the cross - strait air service introduced by macao airlines , macao 's role as an important channel between the two sides of the taiwan straits has become more prominent .
after macao 's return to the motherland , the relationship between the msar and the region of taiwan has become a special component part of the cross - strait relationship .
the nongovernmental exchanges between macao and taiwan meet the needs of mutual benefit .
their basic spirit is to adhere to the " one country , two systems " principle and , under the one china principle , maintain and develop nongovernmental contacts and exchanges between macao and taiwan and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of macao and taiwan compatriots .
regarding taiwan institutions and personnel in macao , they are requested to abide by the macao basic law and not to engage in activities contravening the one china principle .
these principles and policies are the ground for the msar to deal with affairs related to taiwan and also the guarantee and norm for carrying out macao - taiwan exchanges and activities .
for a long time in the past , people of various circles and social organizations in macao , in the activities of contacts and exchanges between macao and taiwan , have done a great deal of work for promoting the peaceful reunification of the mainland and taiwan .
in his important speech on taiwan , president jiang spoke highly of the contribution made by hong kong and macao compatriots and the chinese nationals abroad .
macao , as the second station in the process of reunification of the motherland , plays the role of connecting link between what comes before and what goes after .
the application of the " one country , two systems " in macao has exerted positive influence on taiwan .
shenzhen , 14 feb ( xinhua ) - - li peng , member of the politburo of the cpc central committee and chairman of the national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee , has conducted investigation and study at shenzhen in recent days .
in the springtime of the year of the dragon , flower - decked shenzhen is imbued with a joyful and celebratory atmosphere .
in 1993 li peng gladly wrote the inscription " yantian port , pearl of the south " for yantian port which was then under construction .
today this place has become one of the mainland 's largest ocean - going container freight ports .
last year the port handled 15.89 million containers , a figure which lifted the port into the status of china 's second largest container port .
li peng endorsed the success of the port in construction and operations , and expressed the hope that the port will play a still more positive role in stimulating economic development in shenzhen and south china .
the first stage of the lingao nuclear power plant ( that is , no . 2 ) is proceeding smoothly , and the work has switched from foundation work to installation .
li peng said that guangdong nuclear power has achieved great success in recent years , and i hope you will continue to work hard and do still better .
there are always difficulties when advancing , but you already have a quite strong economic and talent basis and experience , so you can forge ahead with full confidence .
speaking on the development of guangdong nuclear power , li peng said that care must be taken to build the no . 2 plant project and ensure it is up to the mark in quality and capacity .
regarding the no . 3 plant , i advocate on - the - spot expansion ; the advantage is that this will ensure safety and also save money .
we are relatively familiar with and have relatively abundant experience in and mastery of the type of reactor and technology of the daya bay plant .
li peng demanded that china speed up its own capability in nuclear power construction ; he also hoped that guangdong nuclear power will provide experience for china 's nuclear power construction .
high - tech industry is the industry with greatest development prospects in shenzhen ; last year output value of these industries was 8.1979 trillion yuan [ as received ] , accounting for 40.5 percent of total industrial output value .
li peng said that the development of high - tech industry has spurred the restructuring of the economy and industry , and shenzhen 's methods and experiences merit summing up .
in developing high - tech industries , apart from factors such as funds , technology , and talent , it is also necessary to have a good mechanism ; the government 's role in macroeconomic regulation and control is also extremely important in marked economy conditions .
the course of shenzhen 's development has been unusual ; it is the result of the guidance of deng xiaoping theory , the correct leadership of the cpc central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core , and the common efforts of the 4 million people of shenzhen .
he pointed out that in recent years shenzhen has summoned up resolve to vigorously tackle the building of spiritual civilization and cracked down hard on pornography , gambling , and narcotics , thus creating a good social environment .
li peng also pointed out that the more the economy develops , the more necessary it is to administer the city according to law .
the state has granted shenzhen local legislative powers , and shenzhen must take advantage of this strong point to do still better in administering the city according to law .
li peng hoped that the shenzhen people 's congress will actively explore supervision according to law , so as to promote administration and fair adjudication according to law .
it has also provided new opportunities and useful resources for the development of china 's national industry .
today , this newspaper organized people from some relevant industries and units to talk freely and to their hearts content about the great plan of using scientific education to vitalize the country and increase the national strength , and offer this to readers .
at the beginning of the new year , this reporter visited shen chunnian [ 3088 2504 1628 ] , chairman of china space foundation .
chairman shen is an eyewitness to china 's space development .
china 's space industry can be described as the model of development of china 's national industry .
chairman shen had the good fortune to participate in the early planning of our country 's manned space flight project .
now and again , he became excited when talking about the successful launch and recovery of the shenzhou experimental spacecraft .
he said : the manned space flight project is a massive and complicated systematic project that concentrates today 's high and new technologies . at present , only the united states and russia have the ability to conduct manned space flights .
chairman shen opined : the development of china 's space industry has given beneficial inspiration and experience to our national industrial sector , particularly scientific and technological enterprises .
as the chairman of the china space foundation , he has always thought about how the foundation could do its bit in the development of china 's national industry .
funds for the foundation have mainly come from voluntary donations from china 's and overseas enterprises , groups , and individuals that show concern for and support the development of china 's space undertakings .
he opined : the china space foundation should also become the bridge between china 's space industry and national enterprises , and provide useful scientific and technological resources for the development of enterprises by capitalizing on the scientific and technological edge of china 's space industry .
at the same time , enterprises can also provide the required products and technologies to the space industry .
the foundation will make wholehearted contributions to strengthen the connections , links , and understanding between china 's space industry and national enterprises , and enable china 's space industry and national enterprises to soar together .
the successful launch and return of the china - designed " shenzhou " spacecraft last october marked a major historic breakthrough in china 's technology for manned space missions .
with the rapid development of economic globalization and knowledge economy today , competition of overall national strength is essentially a competition of technological innovation .
an important reason why we have been able to score such a splendid achievement in space technology is that we persist in technological innovation and are committed to conquering the frontiers of high technology in the world .
as an enterprise , competition in the market mainly finds expression in technological competition .
whoever grasps the latest technology grasps the source of economic growth .
we are deeply aware of this when we look back over the course of our company 's development over the past few decades .

ji rongzhen is a laid - off woman worker living in tuoluo town , zhenhai district , ningbo city , zhejiang .
after her husband died of illness , she endured all kinds of hardships to raise her son and then sent him to the army after he grew up .
she also worked outside her native place to earn a living so that her son could concentrate on making contributions to the army .
when ji qi became terminally ill , she raised money by herself to lessen the burden on the army .
even though she suffered all kinds of hardships in life , she has never changed her faith and continued to love the country and support the army .
chi haotian told ji rongzhen : you and your son 's advanced deeds have aroused strong responses in the entire army and nation . i am deeply moved by your patriotism and your support of the army .
all officers and men should learn from you and your son .
since he became ill , he has received care and help from the army and all sectors of society in every possible way .
without the love of the army and society , he could not have lived today . i am sincerely grateful to the party and the army !

the aforesaid incidents reflect serious problems of youth education in some families and schools and in the society at present and deserve a high degree of attention .
renmin ribao on 12 february published a commentator 's article entitled " all members of society should concern themselves with and give support to education undertakings . "
schools of all categories and all levels should attach a high degree of importance to and further strengthen the students ' ideological and political education , moral character education , education in discipline and education in the legal system .
it is necessary to purposefully carry out an education in patriotism , collectivism , and socialism to help the students cultivate correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .
it is necessary to actively organize the students to participate in community service and social practice , improve their social experience , and cultivate their hard - working spirit and indomitable will .
greater efforts should be made to reduce the excessive burden of middle and primary school students and ensure success in this regard .
now , some students ' class work is too heavy , yielding great psychological pressure on them . this will not help young students to grow up healthy and sound ; instead , it tends to create problems in various areas .
starting immediately after this spring term begins , all middle schools and primary schools must resolutely abolish the practice of publishing students ' test score rankings . 4 .
it is necessary to strengthen the teacher ranks and constantly improve the teachers ' ideological , political and professional quality .
after this year 's spring term begins , all localities should generally hold a teachers ' work ethics inspection , and whoever violates work ethics should be sternly dealt with . 5 .
it is necessary to provide scientific guidance for family education and actively seek the parents ' support and cooperation in educational work .
it is necessary to make all members of society concern themselves with and support the educational work and create a good social environment for cultivating people .
a determination must be made to improve order in schools and the public order surrounding schools , resolutely combat crimes that harm young students ' healthy growth , and ensure that the students have a quiet , harmonious , and healthy study environment .
president jiang also expounded this ideology in detail in the report to the subsequent 15th party congress ( 1997 ) and in a speech given at the new year tea party held by the chinese people 's political consultative conference .
pinning our hopes on the taiwan people for the realization of national reunification is determined by the nature , basic stand , and purpose of our party .
according to the basic viewpoint of historical materialism , the people , and only the people , have the power to create history .
in resolving the taiwan issue and to realize peaceful unification , surely we have to hold talks with the taiwan authorities .
but the party and government have all along stressed that it would " all the more pin hopes on the taiwan people . "
the words " all the more " fully reflect that we have paid attention to and respected the opinions and role of the taiwan people .
in other words , in addition to allowing taiwan compatriots to reflect their views of developing cross - strait relations and realizing reunification at any time to the party and government , they may also be allowed to participate in the cross - strait talks .
" all the more pinning hopes on the taiwan people " is not only an idea ; it also has a specific content .
the cpc and the chinese government have paid attention to the role of the taiwan people in the process of resolving the taiwan issue and wholeheartedly relied on the taiwan people . any unbiased people can be seen in the development of cross - strait relations over the years .
taiwan compatriots are also the core force opposing separation and " taiwan independence . "
the relevant taiwan authorities have conducted many opinion polls to support their policies and proposals on splittism .
regarding these polls , only by making in - depth analysis can we see through the appearance to perceive the essence .
we can say that taiwan people have played an important role in safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity and guaranteeing that the status of taiwan as part of china must not be changed .
at present , the situation in taiwan island is complicated and changeable , and the development of the cross - strait relationship is now at a crucial moment .
this fully demonstrates our utter sincerity for bringing about peaceful reunification .
but , if the separatist and " taiwan independence " forces within the island obstinately cling to their own course , trying by various ways to separate taiwan from china and create " taiwan independence , " then we cannot but adopt resolute measures .
that " taiwan independence " would only lead to war is not alarmist talk .
compatriots on the both sides of the strait should unite to oppose division , stop the plot for " taiwan independence , " and join efforts to strive for a bright prospect of peaceful reunification .
if the bill becomes law , it will free the united states from the restrictions of the " 17 august communique " and specifically make the united states ' security promises to taiwan into laws .
when the time comes , whether taiwan joins the tmd system , the united states and taiwan have entered a quasi - alliance .
during the current " vacuum period " wherein there is no way to contain china , enhancing its relations with taiwan , particularly military cooperation , is undoubtedly a kind of restraint on china .
this is of course also a product of internal struggle within the united states .
the republican and democratic parties have begun their campaigns to contend the next presidential throne and several presidential candidates have one after another issued their hard - line speeches against china .
meanwhile , to take shelter under the united states ' protective umbrella , taiwan authorities have invested a tremendous amount of human resources , materials , and money in recent years and are willing to pay high prices to employ agents from the united states .
the passage of the " taiwan security enhancement act " bill by the us house is exactly a " major achievement " of the " money diplomacy " taiwan has promoted in the past years .
the article says that it has noted that us president clinton and secretary of state albright have recently said that the us government will ultimately veto the bill .
stimulated by these two major favorable measures , the shenzhen and shanghai stock markets rose strongly on the very first trading day of the year of dragon , opening with an exceptionally huge upward gap and going all the way up under an extremely lively market atmosphere .
both markets posted an average gain of more than nine percent at the close , with the total volume of transaction almost touching 50 billion [ shares ] .
the chinese stock market , after more than 10 years of development which saw it growing out of nothing and expanding from a small to a large scale , is already of a fairly significant size .
funds raised through the stock market grew from the 5 billion yuan in 1992 to 130 billion yuan in 1997 and more than 150 billion yuan in 1999 .
the number of listed companies grew from a dozen or so before 1992 to more than 900 in late 1999 , with the market capitalization peaking at over 3.1 trillion yuan in just a matter of a few years .
it can be said that the chinese stock market has developed by leaps and bounds over the past decade to become an emerging market that has drawn worldwide attention .
in recent years , the chinese government has been taking measures to promote the development of the stock market .
on the two newly published measures , experts analyzed : the system of stock issue implemented in china in the past divided the market into the primary and secondary markets .
nevertheless , there has been a great difference between the stock prices on the primary market and the prices of stocks on their first day of trading on the secondary market .
with the implementation of a new mode of stock issue , secondary market investors may participate in new stock subscription , based on the market value of their holdings of securities in circulation on the market .
the proportion of such allotments shall be 50 percent of the portion of issue left over after the priority allotment to securities investment funds , while the remaining 50 percent shall still be retained for the primary market .
as secondary market investors can participate in new stock subscription based on the market value of their stocks in circulation , this will greatly reduce the possible profits to be realized through professional new - stock subscription in the primary market .
furthermore , the measure of allotting stocks to the secondary market will , to a certain degree , change the habits of market operation .
this will form a periodic pattern where every new stock issue will bring a brisk market .
as provided for in the " procedures for regulating securities companies ' stock collateral loans , " collateral pledged for stock collateral loans has to be renminbi - denominated common stocks or securities investment fund certificates under a securities company 's own account .
the borrower shall be the head office of a comprehensive securities company , while the lender shall be a solely state - owned commercial bank or any of its authorized branch offices or the head office of other commercial banks .
with this move , securities companies will have more relaxed funding in the days to come and this will be beneficial to their operations in the secondary market .
any violations of these provisions shall be subject to corresponding punitive measures .
many people in the securities industry believe the two new measures announced by the csrc and the central bank are conducive to stimulating the stock market .
furthermore , this will draw stock investment funds from various quarters , such as enterprises dealing in " third - category commodities , " that have been looking on from the sidelines , thereby increasing capital inflow into the secondary market .
in addition , as a result of concentrated stockholding by the main forces , the strength of large organizations such as securities dealers and funds in applying for stocks will grow further .
as good stocks are recognized by the market and naturally have high prices , a securities dealer can obtain fresh funds by pledging its holdings of good stocks for bank loans .
it can thus be fostered among investors the perception that good stocks are valuable while interior stocks could be cast aside by the market .
li zhaoxing pointed out that the consequences would be more serious [ geng jia yan zhong 2577 0502 0917 6850 ] than the 1995 visit of lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] to the us if the tsea becomes a us law .
in his letter to li zhaoxing dated on 9 february , helms said he was " aghast " at the remarks made by minister liu xiaoming of the chinese embassy at a news conference on 3 february on the passing of tsea by the house of representatives .
he asked ambassador li zhaoxing to " clarify " liu xiaoming 's remarks that the consequences would be more serious than lee teng - hui 's us visit if the tsea is passed by the us congress .
in his reply letter , li zhaoxing said that having reviewed the relevant transcripts and notes on liu xiaoming 's remarks at the news conference , he did not find anything wrong or inappropriate .
he said : china has always strongly opposed to the tsea and it has made no attempt to conceal this stand .
it is justified and reasonable for china to adopt this stand .
first , the bill negates the important " one china " principle and undermines the basic framework of the normalization of china - us ties by treating taiwan as a state .
second , it violates us pledges under the three sino - us joint communiques by calling on the us to greatly upgrade its military ties with taiwan and increase its arms sales .
third , it fans up a scare about the false " china threat " by authorizing the us military to give annual reports on the situation in the taiwan strait and make military responses accordingly .
li zhaoxing said : some congressmen did not have adequate knowledge of the origin of the taiwan issue and the evolution of sino - us relations , especially the us pledge on this issue in the three sino - us joint communiques .
accompanied by air force leaders liu shunyao and qiao qingchen , cmc members fu quanyou , yu yongbo , wang ke , wang ruilin , kuo boxiong , and xu caihou visited the exhibition .
zhang wannian and others highly praised the air force aircraft operation and maintenance system 's achievements in studying high technology and mastering new equipment .
it is hoped that everybody has an even clearer understanding of the situation , and has a clear understanding of their sacred mission as well as the important role of science and technology training of troops in raising combat effectiveness .
we must do well in learning high technology and new knowledge by persisting in a hierarchical and prioritized manner . we must stress putting knowledge into practice , and realize conversion of knowledge into higher standards and conversion of technological potential into actual combat effectiveness .
we must exert vigorous efforts to form systems and combat effectiveness out of new equipment , thereby giving full play to the operational effectiveness of new equipment .
we must do a good job of sorting out and verifying research results on operational methods . we must promptly and properly convert established results , incorporate them into operation regulations and training programs and materials , and promote their applications among military units .
the requirement of " better to let talent wait for equipment than to let equipment wait for talent " raised by chairman jiang zemin must be implemented among military units .
zhang wannian said : we must continue to exert efforts in upholding a scientific spirit and a pragmatic attitude .
we must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .
wu quanxu , zhang shutian , su shuyan , xiao zhentang , and tan yuexin , leaders of the four general departments of the people 's liberation army and the cmc general office , visited the exhibition .
beijing , 15 feb ( xuinhua ) - - using foreign capital is an important aspect of china 's opening - up policy .
the utilization of foreign capital is playing an increasingly important role in china 's economic construction and the chinese people 's lives .
our country actually used $ 40.4 billion of foreign capital in 1999 . though we maintained a certain scale in this regard , the utilization of foreign capital dropped by 12.8 percent compared with the previous year ; it was the first negative growth rate in recent years .
in addition to the impact of the asian financial crisis , an important cause was that we still did not quite adapt ourselves to the trend of change in the form of direct international investment .
now , more than half of direct global investments have been made in the form of merger and acquisition by transnational enterprises , and over 90 percent of such mergers and acquisitions have taken place in developed countries .
such changes have brought new challenges to our country in attracting foreign capital .
in the face of the new trend in the movement of international capital , we must further emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and attract as much foreign capital as possible in order to contribute more to the development of the national economy .
in the past , our country attracted foreign capital for production projects . from now on , we should strive to open the commercial , financial , insurance , telecommunications , tourism , and other service fields wider to the outside world .
some of the service markets in our country have a tremendous potential , which are very attractive to foreign businessmen , and they will become new hot places to attract foreign businessmen .
then , we should make vigorous efforts to attract famous transnational corporations to invest in china and encourage such corporations to set up research and development centers here in order to expedite technological progress and industrial upgrading .
shanghai municipality , the largest industrial city in our country , now takes attracting the investment of transnational corporations as the focal point of its work in inviting businessmen from the outside to invest in the municipality .
now 254 of the world 's 500 major enterprises have entered shanghai , and they have invested in 510 enterprises , with the total contracted amount of foreign investments reaching $ 9.365 billion .
those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition . this has raised shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high - tech industries .
tianjin , shenzhen , and jiangsu have also gained successful experiences in attracting investments by transnational corporations .
besides , it is necessary to vigorously attract foreign investment to develop high - level processing trade .
our country has two favorable conditions for attracting foreign capital : one is the tremendous market potential , and the other is relatively cheap labor .
in localities with favorable conditions , it is essential to change the traditional investment by foreign businessmen in labor - intensive processing trade to a kind of processing trade to develop new and high - tech products .
the shenzhen special economic zone has gone all out to encourage processing - trade enterprises to shift to high - tech processing ; now in shenzhen , high - tech processing trade has become a new hot place in which foreign businessmen have been investing .
overall , the investment environment in china has continuously improved , and our country is still the most attractive of the developing countries .
beijing , 15 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today : china attaches importance to and is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the g-8 .
it has been reported that , led by japan , the g-8 countries feel that china should be invited to the g-8 summit to be held in japan 's okinawa in july .
it is learned that china has on many occasions previously made known its stand on its relations with the g-8 .
at a news conference held by the ministry of foreign affairs today , zhu bangzao again stressed this issue further .
he said : china hopes that the g-8 can play an active role in enhancing international cooperation and promoting stable and balanced world economic development , particularly in narrowing the gap between the south and the north .
zhu bangzao pointed out : china has always advocated that consultation , coordination , and decision - making on global issues should have wide representation .
when discussing global issues , it is necessary to listen more to opinions of other countries , especially those from the developing countries .
the spokesman pointed out : china attaches importance to the role played by the g-8 and has always maintained contact with the g-8 .
in recent years , before and after every g-8 summit , the presiding country will always report to china .
he said : the chinese side hopes this practice will continue .
it is universally known that china has built its navy mainly by making self - reliant efforts , with imported foreign equipment as a supplement .
people still remember the grand troop review , which was held on 1 october last year to mark the 50th founding anniversary of the prc . the navy 's three unarmed formations , four missile formations , and two flight echelon formations participated in the parade .
midshipmen and sailors from naval surface warship academies and submarine schools as well as the navy 's fighter planes formed a three - dimensional panorama , presenting before the chinese people and the world a complete new look of the chinese navy .
it is also the earliest branch established by the navy . the chinese navy has expanded its surface warship unit . now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .
the authoritative personage said : at present , the chinese navy is making efforts to accelerate its modernization of operational capability . major warships in the navy 's armament alley have been built by china itself and been equipped with missiles .
meanwhile , the invisibility requirement has also been taken into consideration while designing a warship .
besides , the chinese navy 's newest guided missile destroyer , no. 167 , has been put into service .
its special invisibility feature is even more prominent . it has a greater tonnage with an even higher degree of automation . new progress has been made in the quantity and quality of its weaponry , driving power , and the functions of various command and control systems .
china also has developed " 53h2 - type " guided missile escort ships , which are equipped with " three defenses " capability and an electronic war system .
in addition to acquiring new chinese - built warships and submarines , china also has tried to greatly increase its navy 's operational capability by purchasing the most advanced warships and military equipment of the world .
these missiles , which fly at an altitude of about one meter above sea level , are very difficult for radar to detect .
it was learned that , among the weapons used by a warship , this kind of missile is the most effective . so far there have been no defensive weapons against them .
about 85 percent of major battleships and naval air force pilots participated in the drills . as a result , naval units have acquired training under conditions similar to a real combat situation .
beijing , 15 feb ( xinhua ) - - at 4:00 this afternoon , a man killed himself in the southeast part of tiananmen square by detonating an explosive .
according to investigations by public security , the dead man was li xiangshan , a mental patient from hubei province .
at the time of the explosion , a south korean tourist was also injured .
beijing , 15 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today : china opposes an arms race in outer space and hopes that the international community will adopt effective measures to prevent the employment of weapons and an arms race in outer space .
it is learned that hu xiaodi , china 's permanent representative in geneva , made a formal proposal to the conference on disarmament on 10 february on holding negotiations to reach a global treaty on banning tests , deployment , and use of arms in outer space .
china 's proposal was immediately supported by the russian representative .
at a news conference held by the ministry of foreign affairs here , zhu bangzao said : outer space belongs to all of mankind and all countries have the equal right to explore and use outer space for peaceful purposes .
he said : it is the common aspiration of all mankind to prevent the employment of weapons and an arms race in outer space .
therefore , it is realistic and urgent for the international community to take effective measures to prevent the development of such a negative situation .
as for the so - called " sino - russian joint opposition to an arms race in outer space , " zhu bangzao said clearly that it is inaccurate .
he said : countries that oppose an arms race in outer space are definitely not only limited to china and russia .
the 54th un general assembly again overwhelmingly passed a resolution on the " prevention of an arms race in outer space , " with 162 countries voting in favor of the resolution .
this fully reflects the common aspiration and pressing demand of the international community .
he expressed the hope that the conference on disarmament in geneva , as the only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum , should make new contributions to the negotiations and conclusion of international legal articles on the prevention of an arms race in outer space .
hu also sought interests for others who had offered him bribes on many an occasion by taking advantage of his position and had thereby caused huge losses to the state property .
the court has also examined , investigated , and verified that between early 1997 and june, 1999 , in order to seek a promotion and have himself transferred to another post , hu offered bribes totaling 80,000 yuan to the relevant people on some five occasions .
besides , hu failed to identify legitimate resources for his wealth worth more than 1.61 million , which had obviously outstripped his legitimate income .
with the penalties added together , the court decided to carry out the execution of hu ; deprive hu of political rights for life ; and confiscate all hu 's property .
hu had entrusted two counsels to defend him in the court .
today , the court publicly pronounced its judgment .
the trial of hu changqing 's case has fully enshrined the socialist principle of rule of law that all offenders are equal before the law and has fully demonstrated the party 's and state 's resolve to severely penalize corruption in accordance with the law .
beijing , 15 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said on 15 february that china hopes the united states abides by the established agreements , and handles prudently the issue of wto accession for mainland china and taiwan .
according to reports , china and the wto members have reached an agreement on that issue , reflected in the council chairman statement of the 1992 general agreement on tariff and trade .

the four countries foreign minister tang jiaxuan will visit are mauritania , tunisia , kuwait , and iran .
when answering a reporter 's relevant question , the spokesman explicitly pointed out that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will not involve military cooperation between the two countries .
now the relations between china and iran are very friendly .
both countries stand for global multipolarization and have fine cooperation in the political , economic , and cultural fields .
he said : constantly developing the friendly cooperative relations between china and iran is a consensus between both sides , corresponds with the fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples , and is also conducive to safeguarding regional peace and stability .

beijing , 15 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today that while being concerned about the attacks on us and japanese websites , china also objects to any form of bad behavior on the internet .
he said : recently some famous us websites and japanese government websites were attacked by hackers , not only inflicting major losses on network service providers , but also causing serious impacts on the normal work and lives of network subscribers .
he said that the chinese government is very concerned about this incident .
he said : as the network economy is one of the important factors promoting a country 's sustained economic growth , network security is of particular importance .
when amending its criminal law in 1999 , china added explicit provisions to the criminal punishment on illegal intrusion into important areas of the computer information system .
in 1997 , with the approval of the state council , the ministry of public security promulgated procedures on protection and management of international network security on the internet . the procedures stipulate that no unit or individual is allowed to enter the computer information network without authorization .
zhu bangzao remarked : the relevant department of the chinese government is actively taking effective measures to really safeguard network security .
as china 's internet is just beginning to develop , it needs a fine environment for development .
any bad behavior on the internet is not welcome .
beijing , 15 feb ( xinhua ) - - the utilization of foreign capital constitutes an important content of china 's opening up policy .
but in the face of new challenges brought about by the new trend of international capital flow , china needs new ideas on utilizing foreign capital in the future .
the utilization of foreign capital is playing an increasingly important role in china 's economic development and people 's livelihood .
last year , the real amount of foreign capital used by china approached $ 40.4 billion . although the amount still maintained a certain scale , it decreased by 12.8 percent as compared with 1998 , representing the first negative growth in recent years .
first , it was affected by the asian financial crisis . another important reason is that china is not yet quite able to adjust itself to the current trend in the practice of international direct investment .
at present , more than 50 percent of direct investment in the world is carried out in a form of acquisition mergers by multinational enterprises . more than 90 percent of such mergers have occurred in advanced countries .
these new changes have ushered in new challenges for china in its efforts to attract foreign capital .
therefore , it is necessary to change ideas to attract as much foreign capital as possible .
previously , china focused on attracting foreign capital for production projects . in the future , more efforts should be made to open our door wider to the outside world in such service sectors as commerce , banking , insurance , telecommunications , and tourism .
the markets of some service sectors in china have a great potential . these sectors , which have an extremely strong power to attract foreign businessmen , will become new hot spots for attracting their investment .
moreover , great efforts should be made to invite famous multinational companies to invest in china . besides , we should encourage these enterprises to establish research and development centers in china in a bid to accelerate technological progress and industrial upgrading .
shanghai city , the largest industrial city in china , has considered attracting investment of multinational enterprises as a key point of its work .
at present , 254 of 500 biggest companies in the world have entered shanghai . the amount of contracted foreign capital for their projects has reached $ 9.3 billion .
these investment projects are large in scale , with high technological content and strong market competitiveness . these projects have enhanced shanghai 's overall level of utilizing foreign capital and accelerated the development of its advanced and new technological industry .
other localities , including tianjin , shenzhen , and jiangsu have also obtained successful experiences in attracting multinational enterprises to make investment in china .
meanwhile , great efforts should be made to attract foreign capital in the higher grade processing trades .
china has two advantages to attract foreign capital . first , it has tremendous market potential . second , it has a comparatively cheap labor force .
as conditions permit , localities should try to turn the labor intensive processing trade - - a traditional domain for foreign investment - - into a processing trade that focuses on the development of advanced and new technological products .
generally speaking , china has made continuous efforts to improve its investment environment . among developing countries , china is still a country with the greatest power to attract foreign capital .
these are moves that will provide a fine external environment for expanding the utilization of foreign capital in a positive and effective way .
recently , the chinese people cannot but express strong indignation at and firm opposition to the " taiwan security enhancement act " (tsea) bill passed by the us house of representatives .
this is a very dangerous political act on the part of the anti - china us forces in its attempt to permanently split china and undermine the great cause of china 's reunification .
once the bill becomes law , it will only incite " taiwan independence " forces into making reckless moves , thereby greatly increasing the possibility of cross - strait and sino - us military conflict and bringing disastrous consequences to sino - us relations .
in terms of content , the bill far exceeds the existing us policy on arms sales to taiwan the " tsea " bill may be rated as the most important house legislation on the question of taiwan in the past two decades .
the main purpose of the bill , which is divided into six sections , is to supplement and further implement the " taiwan relations act " and enhance the united states ' military commitments to taiwan .
in terms of content , it has far exceeded the existing us policy on arms sales to taiwan .
the progenitors of the bill were jesse helms , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , and senator robert torricelli .
the " tsea " bill is the second legal document regulating us - taiwan relations following the " taiwan relations act . "
if the bill becomes law , it will free the united states from the restrictions of the 17 august joint communiqu on us arms sales to taiwan and specify the united states ' security commitments to taiwan in concrete legal clauses .
when the time comes , whether or not taiwan joins the tmd system , the united states and taiwan have entered a quasi - alliance . once events happen in the taiwan strait , the law will provide a legal basis for us armed intervention .
the bill has profound political background the us house of representatives has 435 members , including 222 republicans , 211 democrats , and two nonparty personages .
in the house vote on 1 february , not only the republicans , who called for a tough policy toward china , but also 141 democrats voted for the bill , passing it by an overwhelming majority .
the pro - taiwan and anti - china forces in the us congress have created trouble for many years on the taiwan issue .
pro - taiwan us congressmen made unwarranted charges against the government 's taiwan policy after president clinton , during his visit to china , openly pledged for the first time to pursue the us " three nos " policy on taiwan .
since last year , more than 30 of 80 anti - china proposals have been adopted by the house of representatives alone .
the passage of the " tsea " bill by the house has demonstrated that anti - china figures in the united states wanted to take the bill as a new force to contain china .
in the current " vacuum period " in which there is no weapon available for checking china , strengthening ties with taiwan and , in particular , bilateral military cooperation , is undoubtedly a way of containing china .
such containment can also serve as a bargaining chip in developing relations with the mainland .
of course , this is also the outcome of the us internal struggle .
the presidential race between the republican and democratic parties has started . several presidential candidates made speeches advocating a tough policy on china .
" achievement " of taiwan 's costly " dollar diplomacy " in recent years , the taiwan authorities have squandered considerable manpower , material , and financial resources and employed us agents with high pay in a bid to place itself under the us protective umbrella .
the passage of the " tsea " bill by the us house is a " substantial achievement " of the " dollar diplomacy " taiwan has pursued for many years .
according to us media reports , one of the major backstage promoters of the smooth passage of the " tsea " bill was cassidy and associates , the us - based public relations firm commissioned by taiwan .
half of the congressmen cassidy and associates have always contacted are cosignatories of the " tsea " bill .
an internal document of the us department of justice showed that the service fees taiwan paid cassidy and associates rose by 37 percent from january to june 1999 alone .
the document pointed out that a key figure responsible for promoting the adoption of the bill - - gejdenson , ranking democratic member of the house of representatives committee on international relations - - received political contributions five times from cassidy and associates in march 1999 alone .
united states has never halted arms sales to taiwan for a long time , previous us governments had deemed taiwan as a chess piece used for containing china .
after the establishment of sino - us diplomatic relations , the united states was forced to withdraw armed forces from taiwan . however , it then adopted the " taiwan relations act , " assuming responsibility to protect taiwan with force .
to placate the congress soon after the release of the " 17 august communiqu , " the united states announced that it agreed to cooperate with taiwan again in making 30 f-5e and f-5f fighters .
the following year the united states sold taiwan military equipment worth $ 500 million , including 60 f-104 fighters .
to reverse the unfavorable trend in the 1992 presidential race , president bush announced a decision to sell 150 f-16a / b warplanes to taiwan .
while in office , clinton first set a precedent by allowing lee teng - hui and other senior taiwan officials and military officers to visit the united states . in 1996 , he provided military support for lee teng - hui 's presidential campaign .
from 1994 to 1998 , the united states sold taiwan military equipment totaling $ 2 billion .
while being committed to the " three nos " policy last year , the us government still approved arms sales to taiwan worth $ 250 million and planned to incorporate taiwan into the tmd system .
their purpose in doing so is to sell advanced weapons and equipment to taiwan , to promote and expand the " legal basis " for us - taiwan military cooperation , and to create " one china , one taiwan " or " two chinas . "
they fight each other in the form of making a fuss together or playing a duet .
this kind of contention will enable the president to take an uncompromising stand on china under the pretext of " pressure from the congress " in an attempt to force china to make concessions on certain issues .
the fundamental interests of the us congress and the government are identical . they are only adopting different means and measures .
oksenberg , senior research fellow at the asia - pacific research center under stanford university , said that the best way for ensuring taiwan 's security is to cooperate with rather than face a confrontation with beijing .
close us - taiwan relations cannot guarantee taiwan security .
in short , when china takes military actions , the united states might assist taiwan . even though the united states wins the war , taiwan will be destroyed in flames of war . there is another implication in oksenberg 's remarks .
in other words , if united states enters the war against china , it will lose its current hegemonist position in the world no matter who wins the war .
therefore , the act does not conform to the interests of the united states and taiwan .
at present , the house of representatives has enough votes to overturn the president 's veto . but it is hard to predict what will happen in the senate .
recently , president clinton and secretary of state madeleine albright respectively have issued a statement stressing that the us government will eventually veto the act .
history has proven that the chinese people never waver in their determination to safeguard the reunification of their motherland . it is extremely dangerous for anyone to try to go one step beyond the limit .
if this aggravates tension in the taiwan strait and sparks a war , the united states will not be able to shirk its responsibility for it in history .
an extraordinarily big explosion occurred in china 's most sensitive place - - tiananmen square in beijing , which shocked both china and the world .
a source from beijing said that a central department conveyed a document to the officials at and above the ministerial and commission level , referring the event to xinjiang terrorist activities .
a political bureau meeting scheduled for today is likely to present a report on the latest progress on the event , the source said .
public security personnel who first arrived at the site used mats to cover the dead bodies .
tiananmen square was unsealed two and a half hours later .
nevertheless , this explosion , which possibly could be suicidal behavior , came all of a sudden .
hence , it has been very difficult for the security personnel on site to guard against such practices .
in the more than 20 years since the launch of reform and opening up , china 's socialist construction has achieved successes which have caught the attention of the whole world .
at present , china 's reform and opening up and modernization are in a key period of carrying on the cause and forging ahead into the future .
internationally , economic globalization is developing rapidly , science and technology are progressing by leaps and bounds , and economic ties between countries are unprecedentedly close and their influence on each other is increasing .
joining the wto will have a profound impact on china 's socioeconomic development and on reform and opening up .
the important role of the wto in the world today the wto was established in 1995 . its predecessor was the general agreement on tariffs and trade [ gatt ] , which came into effect in 1948 .
the wto provides the basic rules and regulations for international business activity by holding negotiations and signing agreements .
second , to organize multilateral trade negotiations .
as a result of eight rounds of multilateral negotiations held by the wto and its predecessor , gatt , its member states have greatly lowered their tariff barriers , and this has stimulated the development of international trade and world economy to a tremendous extent .
in the past half century , the weighted average tariff level of the developed countries has dropped from about 40 percent in 1948 to about 3.8 percent at present . the weighted average tariff level of the developing countries has now dropped to about 14 percent .
third , to settle trade disputes between members .
the wto 's dispute settlement mechanism plays an important role in ensuring the effective implementing of wto agreements and settling trade disputes between members , thereby creating a stable environment for the smooth development of international trade .
joining the wto and further expanding our opening up to the world will be of great significance for spurring the development of our national economy .
joining the wto will help to create a good international environment for china 's reform , opening up , and modernization .
joining the wto will help to speed up china 's industrial restructuring and continually improve the international competitiveness of china 's economy .
take agriculture as an example .
joining the wto will benefit china in participating better in the process of economic globalization .
acting according to the international rules in lowering tariffs and nontariff barriers will benefit china in fully participating in globalized production and international division of work .
at the same time , joining the wto will also help to strengthen china 's cooperation with multinational corporations .
a few days ago , nato decided to replace landcent ( the allied forces ' command in central europe ) with the eurocorps , a non - nato staff department , as the head of the peacekeeping force in kosovo (kfor) .
this spectacular initiative by nato not only signifies the first independent move by eurocorps but also marks the acceleration of the pace in the creation of an independent security setup by eu .
arguably , it is truly not easy for eu to get what some have jokingly called " lieutenant 's command " from the mammoth military apparatus of nato .
as known to all , along with the advance of europe 's integration process , european countries ' reliance on the united states for security has also declined to some extent and the development of " europe - unique defense " has been placed on the agenda .
in its 1995 report , " european security policy in the year 2000 , " the eu executive committee indicated that eu 's common security and foreign policy should aim at establishing a european collective security mechanism .
during their summit held at the end of 1998 , french and british leaders published a " declaration on european defense , " asserting that eu should rely on a reliable military force and acquire the ability for independent military action . "
in addition , many european countries also maintained that nato 's reform and its new strategy should further reflect " europe - unique defense . "
in 1992 , the armed forces of germany , france , and three other european countries set up the eurocorps without the participation of americans . the eurocorps is under the western european union and has nothing to do with nato .
at the end of last year , eu also decided to establish a 50,000 - men to 60,000 - men rapid reaction force by 2003 as europe 's own security safeguard organization capable of taking action within 60 days of the outbreak of a crisis .
next month , eu will set up a " political and security council " to formulate policies and strategies for its crisis management apparatus , the rapid reaction force .
yet , the united states has consistently checked eu 's long - cherished aspiration and action to develop its own defense setup .
in the past , european countries have always depended on the united states for their military and security safeguards . the outbreak of a number of crises hitting the european continent in recent years has made it realize the crisis facing it .
especially during europe 's internal crises , such as the bosnia - herzegovina and kosovo crises , eu felt helpless and found it difficult to deal with the crisis on their own .
precisely because of this helplessness , eu has accelerated the pace to establish an independent defense setup , a defense setup that is not " purely an idea but possesses the ability to enforce . "
the new role to be played by the eurocorps has truly gladdened eu countries , even if it does not constitute a milestone in eu 's independent defense .
public opinion believes that the eurocorps ' directing nato - dominated military operations for the first time in history will test eu 's ability to operate independently in the military field .
editor 's note : with the dawn of a new millennium , governments of all countries are drawing up development blueprints for a new century .
starting from today , we will run a series of reports by this correspondent on " moving toward a new millennium , " briefing readers on the future expectations of various countries , their strategic thoughts on development , and how they seize opportunities to cope with challenges .
in early spring , china 's northern neighbor , russia , is moving toward a new millennium with new hopes .
russian economics minister shabowayachi [ sha bo wa li yang ci 3097 3134 3907 0448 2254 5412 ] announced that in 1999 , russia 's gdp grew 3.2 percent , while its industrial output rose 8.1 percent .
for the past few years , russia 's economic indicators have reached the highest level .
in the first 10 months of last year , direct foreign investment in russia hit $ 3.1 billion , 1.6 times more than the corresponding period the preceding year . this is the result of the improvement in the investment environment .
according to russian state statistics commission statistics , the actual household income for the new year will be up 2-4 percentage points over last year , and direct foreign investment will top $ 5 billion .
the new russian state duma was elected at the end of last year .
the majority of new duma members advocated consultation and cooperation with the kremlin instead of opposing it .
due to president yeltsin 's early resignation , russia has a new state leader at the start of 2000 .
in handling the issue of chechnya , putin complied with popular will and curbed resolutely and promptly the illegal armed forces in chechnya .
people notice that on the issue of chechnya , the russian government not only has enjoyed support from various political forces but also has brought about the unity of the whole nation . this is a political phenomenon rarely seen for many years in russia .
at the first government work conference this year , putin proposed three major tasks for 2000 : first , formulating strategies and plans for national economic development . second , maintaining the present favorable economic momentum . third , consolidating and improving the state power mechanism .
in practice , putin placed particular emphasis on the development of science and technology , education , and chechnya 's economic recovery .
before that , putin told some scientists and university students at russia 's first science festival , that : " science and technology and education are a driving force for resolving russian issues . without being competitive in science and technology , the country will have no future . "
he was of the view that russia needs a systematic reform in science and technology to ensure the steady growth of its national economy and to increase investment in science and technology departments .
the russian government has a better understanding of the situation and the tasks facing it .
russia 's production standard is so backward that the quantity of its high - tech products has been doubly reduced .
for the past decade , russia has seen a lower economic efficiency , a decrease in investment in science and technology , and a lack of enthusiasm for production investment , thus significantly undermining the social productive forces .
with the arrival of the new millennium , russia lost a free secondary school education system and a public health services system , for which it strove for many years .
the gap between rich and poor and the growing number of the poor are social phenomena in russia .
while russia 's crime rate is going up , its living standard is declining .
hence , russia first should step up efforts to develop " locomotive " products - - scientific and technological products - - and sharpen its competitive edge in the international market in order to spur overall economic growth .
russia 's strategic goal is to establish a powerful russia .
at the turn of the century , a new and dynamic atmosphere indeed prevailed in russia , and the people pinned their hopes on russia 's future .
according to economists , the present favorable economic momentum is the result of the depreciation of the ruble and the price rises in crude oil and raw materials in the international market .
these factors are temporary . a country 's positive economic operation depends primarily on the increase in both investment and aggregate demand .
there is no optimism about these two major economic indicators for russia .
in addition , saddled with massive debts , the russian government has to allocate $ 6.5 billion , or 40 percent of the state budget , for repaying foreign debts in 2000 alone .
with the advent of the 21st century , russia has seen hopes and ushered in rare opportunities while at the same time facing many rigorous challenges .

dreier said : the house leadership plans to vote on the agreement by 1 august at the latest . the vote is extremely important for maintaining us economic prosperity ; it is probably the most important vote of this fiscal year .
armey expressed the hope that congress would vote before the end of july .
the lawmakers also distributed a report of findings by the us congressional research service on the agreement on china 's accession to the wto .
the report states : china is currently one of the world 's fastest - developing economies , and it is expected to become the world 's largest market for consumer goods and services .
china 's accession to the wto will provide the united states with an opportunity for massive exports to and investments in china .
citing projections by us secretary of agriculture dan glickman , the report states that implementation of the us - china agreement on china 's accession to the wto may increase us exports of agricultural products to china by $ 2 billion each year .
china and the united states signed an agreement on china 's accession to the wto in beijing last november . the agreement will take effect only after it is approved by the us congress .
last year , trade with taiwan had such a salient characteristic : direct trade grew rapidly whereas indirect trade fell in proportion .
as direct shipping introduced between the two shores on a trial basis at selected spots in 1996 has ended the situation that the mainland trade with taiwan was mainly centered on indirect trade , direct trade has developed rapidly .
from 1994 to 1999 , annual direct import from taiwan rose from $ 1.68 billion to $ 7.02 billion , up by 33.1 percent on an average , and annual export to taiwan from $ 530 million to $ 2.4 billion , up by 35.3 percent on an average .
thanks to its rapid growth , direct trade rose by a large margin in proportion in import and export trade with taiwan , up from 12 percent and 24 percent in 1994 to 36 percent and 61 percent in 1999 respectively .
one more salient characteristic of trade with taiwan is that general import and export trade grew by a large margin and processing trade turned into the biggest source of trade deficit .
at the same time , they transferred armed police corps commanders and put into effect a system of rotational transfers .
besides strengthening their missile defense and attack capabilities , the chinese communists recently went further to deploy the israeli phalcon radar on russian - made illusion-76 transport aircraft , thus possessing a preliminary airborne early warning capability .
on other issues , 41.6 percent of those polled were of the view that it is nothing unusual for presidential candidates to own real estate overseas , and 31.9 percent felt it is inappropriate .
on china 's unification and taiwan independence , 57.5 percent of those polled favored maintaining the status quo , and those favoring taiwan independence and unification between the two sides of the strait accounted for 13.9 percent and 10.4 percent respectively .
chief of general staff tang yao - ming yesterday said that the national army is able to fully keep abreast of mainland troop movements during taiwan 's presidential election .
tang yao - ming yesterday held a spring festival dinner party with military reporters from domestic and foreign media .
he pointed out that only a strong national defense can provide a specific guarantee for state security and a secure and happy life for the people . moreover , it is an important basis for the country 's existence and development .
as the times progress unceasingly , the national army should vigorously strive for popular support in order to fulfill the major reform of building the army for war preparedness .
therefore , the remaining 32 percent of voters who had not made up their minds have become the key to deciding the results of the election .
results of the poll showed that the support rating of the ch 'en - lu ticket , which dropped to 21 percent at the end of january due to the stock exchange taxation issue , gained 3 percentage points to reach 24 percent .
with the kuomintang 's [ kmt ] vigorous boost by a full - scale mobilization , support rating of the lien - hsiao ticket gained by a small margin - - from 19 percent at the end of january to the current 20 percent .
as to other presidential candidates , the hsu hsin - liang - chu huei - liang ticket gained 1 percent , and the other ticket did not show any gains .
voters who had not made up their minds accounted for 32 percent .
although the strength of the three tickets was about the same , on favoritism rating , the lien - hsiao ticket stood out .
the poll showed that 39 percent of voters thought that with the kmt 's huge resources and organizational and mobilization capacity , the lien - hsiao ticket , although its support rating has not risen , eventually will emerge .
this percentage was 5 points higher than the 34 percent found at the end of january .
on the contrary , the favoritism rating of the ch 'en - lu ticket , whose support rating jumped to first place , was in last place .
the poll showed that , although nearly a quarter of voters planned to support ch 'en , only 11 percent thought he will win . compared with the three polls conducted over the past month , the percentage almost remained unchanged .
changes in voter support for lien chan were also minimal , with 51 percent of respondents supporting him and 34 percent not supporting him .
confidence in sung ch 'u - yu was similar to that shown in the previous poll , with 43 percent of respondents saying that they were confident in his ability to handle state affairs , and 39 percent saying that they had no confidence .
the poll was a random survey of respondents selected from residential telephone numbers with the same last two digits , and qualified voters were then selected using the household sampling method . the findings were then weighted by the gender and age of all voters .
more and more people have realized that hackers have become a new public hazard globally and that we must take forceful measures to hack off this black hand that is reaching for the network .
hackers are practically everywhere on the net ; government and military core secrets , enterprises ' commercial secrets , and personal secrets are all among the things they peep at .
the crime of hacking has many new characteristics compared with conventional crimes . 1 .
it is of an intellectual nature .
the offenders generally possess quite a high level of professional techniques and knowledge of computers as well as a mastery of computer operational skills and often would carry out careful planning before committing an offense and contending with anti - hacking forces in a battle of wits . 2 .
it is of a concealed nature .
as the crime of hacking is carried out in a virtual space made up of such intangible elements as programs and data and often is not subject to the restrictions of time and place , it is difficult to trace and monitor the offender . 3 .
it is greatly detrimental to society .
a host of facts have proved that the greater the dependence of society on network systems , the higher the incidence of computer crime becomes .
in recent years , the crime of hacking has been rapidly spreading like a plague to every corner of computer networks and doing greater and greater harm to society .
the issue of network security has drawn great attention from governments and experts of various countries including china .
when designing their networks , many large foreign websites had attached great importance to their security .
even so , nevertheless , these websites still come under frequent attacks by hackers .
he pointed out : networks have developed rapidly in our country but we have rather few experts in network security and some websites still lack security consciousness .
as china 's major organizations are now becoming increasingly dependent on networks , there will be extremely grave consequences should hackers succeed in their assaults .
our country should develop its own anti - hacking technology and must not rely on imports . " if a lock is bought from others , it can be unlocked by others . "
many experts believe it would be difficult to fundamentally put an end to hacking so long as networks exist .
even in the virtual space of networks , people still hope to have an unpolluted , blue sky .
during the 10th five - year plan , an estimated 100 billion yuan will be invested in large and medium - sized railroad construction projects in west china , and it is estimated that the west will have about 18,000 km of railroad by 2005 .
minister of railroads fu zhihuan talked freely about the thinking on railroad development in west china when interviewed by this reporter .
in their policy decision on major development of west china , the cpc central committee and state council have decided to concentrate forces to tackle the important work related to the overall situation of developing west china , and speeding up infrastructure construction is in the primary position .
as the vanguard of the national economy , the railroads are dutybound to exert every effort and summon up still greater determination and provide still greater input in carrying out construction and going ahead of the rest .
fu zhihuan said when recalling the state input in railroad construction in west china since the eighth five - year plan , although the state has stepped up input in construction in west china , the railroads there still fail to meet the requirements of development .
it is estimated that investment in large and medium - sized railroad construction projects in west china during the 10th five - year plan will reach about 100 billion yuan , and that there will be about 18,000 km of railroad in the region by 2005 .
specifically : we will step up the construction of east - west links .
we should improve communications between the western provinces and autonomous regions .
the main focus will be on building the lines from shenmu north to yanan north , xian to ankang , and neijiang to kunming ; at the same time we should get a good grasp of preparatory work for bringing the railroad into tibet .
we should step up the building of international communications .
the main focus will be on building the china - kyrgyzstan - uzbekistan railroad and planning the pan - asia railroad .
we should intensify improvement of the existing lines .
the focus will be on completing the capacity expansion of the xining - germu section of the qinghai - tibet line , electrification of the chengdu - kunming line , and the capacity expansion of forming west china railroad electrification into a network , section by section .
fu zhihuan said that while speeding up railroad construction in west china , we should further implement the strategy for increasing speeds .
through carrying out technical improvements of the equipment and using new locomotives and rolling stock , we should speed up the traveling time for passenger trains into and out of west china .
the passenger train chart for national day this year should embody the initial results in this respect .
for instance , passenger train travel time from beijing to urumqi will be reduced from 60 hours now to 48 hours .
beijing , 16 feb - - the forum on release of the " handbook on taxation knowledge for leading cadres , " compiled by the state administration of taxation , was held in beijing a few days ago .
jiang zemin pointed out that taxation is the major source of state revenues , as well as a key economic lever with which the state regulates and controls the macro - economy .
jiang zemin urged the leading cadres at various levels , especially high - ranking cadres , to conscientiously study taxation knowledge , to familiarize themselves with taxation policies and laws , and to be well versed in the tax collection work .
the " handbook on taxation knowledge for leading cadres " consists of six chapters and concisely introduces state taxation departments ' functions in relation to tax revenues , taxation systems and policies , tax management , handling of tax affairs according to law , and international taxation .
however , the financial experts firmly believe that renminbi will not devaluate in the next few years . on the contrary , there is room for its appreciation .
in shanghai 's renminbi trading market , the exchange rate of renminbi closed by a slight increase today , which , according to a dealer , was affected by the reduced demand for us dollars .
the closing quotation of the us dollar against renminbi was $ 1 to 8.2776 yuan , a slight fall from tuesday 's closing rate of 8.2777 yuan .
although renminbi 's appreciation or depreciation will be affected by the pressure after china 's accession to the wto yet , more importantly , it is the effect of the domestic factors that counts .
he stressed that after entering the wto , china will have a sound equilibrium of international payments , and the exchange rate of renminbi will continue to remain stable .
it is anticipated that the export and investment this year will somewhat increase , and foreign investment will continue to grow as well after china 's accession to the wto .
in terms of exchange rate policy , china still adopts a floating rate system under which exchange rates are controlled and determined by market supply and demand .
thanks to the equilibrium of the international payments , china 's exchange rates have all along been comparatively stable .
a financial expert pointed out that , on the whole , there are three major factors that will make renminbi exchange rate continue to remain firm in the future .
first , the special characteristics and nature of china 's economic growth have conditioned the value and trend of renminbi .
china possesses an exchange reserve amounting to over $ 150 billion and , at the same time , after nearly two years of stagnation , the export exhibits a momentum of vigorous growth .
china 's financial and monetary authorities expect that the implementation of the multi - currency policy and measures in 2000 will also contribute to the stability and appreciation of renminbi 's value .
second , after acceding to the wto , foreign investment in china will reach a new peak , and renminbi exchange rate will continue to remain stable on the basis of the international payments equilibrium .
in the meantime , a relative shortage of domestic resources will arise , making renminbi even more " valuable . "
nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system . if the value of japanese yen plummets and the us dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than renminbi itself .
wu yi pointed out : entry and exit inspection and quarantine departments worked very hard and achieved remarkable results in 1999 .
besides successfully completing the mission of carrying out institutional reform aimed at combining the " three types of inspections , " they achieved fairly good results in performing their duty of enforcing inspection and quarantine laws .
in addition , they actively served the export sector and took the initiative in mapping out measures to reduce fees and improve services .
in the area of fee reduction in particular , they lowered fees on four occasions , slashing levies by as much as 1 billion yuan and greatly alleviating the burden of foreign trade enterprises .
wu yi stressed : faced with the new situation in which china will join the world trade organization , we should expand the role of inspection and quarantine departments .
she urged : we should deepen institutional reform aimed at combining the " three types of inspections . "
we should earnestly improve management , rationalize internal relations , and improve efficiency in law enforcement .
in addition , we should conscientiously tighten supervision and control over the quality of export and import products , and earnestly search for more effective methods of supervision .
wu yi stressed : we should raise our awareness of service and provide good service to the foreign trade sector .
inspection and quarantine departments should draw on their advantages in technology , information , and service to serve enterprises and help them improve product quality , raise their technological standards , and expand exports .
in particular , inspection and quarantine departments play an irreplaceable role in expanding china 's exports of agricultural products .
in trying to expand the utilization of foreign capital , we also need the coordination of inspection and quarantine departments to create an investment climate that is favorable to improving the quality and standard of utilizing foreign capital .
the spirit of the plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission should be seriously carried out and attention should practically be paid to the work of leading officials honesty and self - discipline within the financial sector .
finance is the core of modern economy , he pointed out .
doing good financial work mainly depends on three things ; one is reform , one is technology and management , and another one is political superiority .
while leading officials stressing political awareness , theoretical study and good conduct is the basis of bringing into play the political superiority .
leading cadres of the financial departments at all levels not only are professional cadres in finance , but also before all others are cadres of the party who must restrain themselves by the party constitution and control the overall situation of work from the height of politics .
passing the power barrier means to correctly treat and use power , reasonably use power for the people , manage well the money , stop abusing power for personal gain and trading power for money , wen jiabao pointed out .
the financial sector is in charge of management , use and inspection of credit , bond and insurance fund . under the condition of the market economy , power of controlling financial resource is of vital importance .
the more power we control , the heavier our responsibility is .
we must have the public spirit and insist on principle .
not only should we actively support economic development by providing good financial service , but also should carry out laws and policies of our country by acting in accordance with the market economy planning to guarantee financial security .
we should by no means be able to take advantage of granting loans to ask for or take bribes and take advantage of stock - issuing and insurance settlement to make power - for - money deals .
passing the money barrier requires remaining uncorrupt , absolutely honest , incorruptible , and completely not getting involved in corruption .
it is especially important for leading officials of the financial sector to go through the money pass .
they should do their jobs conscientiously and be faithful in the discharge of their duties to let the party and the people rest assured .
they should enhance practicing the party spirit . they should transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world , nip in the bud and ideologically build a consolidated line of defense .
passing the pleasure - seeking barrier needs to bear hardships before enjoying comforts , needs to be diligent and honest in work , and needs to work hard , wen jiabao said .
at present there exists in some financial institutions a kind of unhealthy tendency of extravagance under which luxury is excessively pursued and money is extravagantly used and negative impacts are formed .
we are communists who should " be concerned before anyone else and enjoy oneself only after everyone else finds enjoyment , " should emulate work contribution and achievement not enjoyment in life .
we should start with the leading cadres to set up good examples for cadres at lower levels .
we should stop meaningless company and spare more time for study . we should go more often to grassroots units to make investigation rather than go to public place of entertainment .
we should make effort to create a tendency of being diligent and honest in work and working hard in the financial sector .
passing the barrier of relatives and friends requires consideration of principles not sensibilities and disciplining well relatives and staff members instead of using power to get illegal benefits for them .
leading cadres should keep a cool head on this issue and must strictly discipline their relatives and children .
leading cadres should also discipline well their staff members .
strict requirements must be set not to allow them to take the advantage of their work and abuse the authority of their leaders to trade for personal gains .
leading cadres should insist on principles , should have the courage to manage or challenge a powerful opponent .
leading cadres at all levels should put themselves under the management and supervision of the party organization .
they should further rigorously enforce inner - party living regulations and list investigation of leading cadres honesty and self - discipline as an important content of meeting of democracy practice .
major issues must be collectively discussed and determined by the party committee in order to avoid personal arbitrary decision .
it is an external supervisory mechanism that the financial departments send their board of supervisors . we should rigorously pay attention to this work to bring into full play the role of the board of supervisors .
we should accept the social and press supervision .
we should publicize our work system , work procedure and work result and heed the critical opinions of the masses .
deputy secretary of the central financial work committee yan haowang presided over the meeting .
beijing , 16 feb ( xinhua ) - - the central authorities have pointed out that we should launch a drive to " look back " for a period of time after the completion of " three stresses " education .
this is an effective way to deepen rectification and reform and to consolidate and enlarge the fruits of education and ensure that the " three stresses " education is not done in a superficial way .
facts have fully shown that the significance of the concentrated " three stresses " education is far - reaching and notable results have been achieved .
we should realize , however , that we cannot overestimate the success achieved ; some of the problems brought to light during the concentrated education have not yet been resolved well , and the task of implementing and completing the rectification and reform scheme remains very arduous .
it should be said that the concentrated education is the " top sheet " of the entire composition , and the thorough rectification and reform after the concentrated education is the " last sheet . "
if the concentrated education was done quite well , but the thorough rectification and reform work has not matched it , the results of the entire " three stresses " education will be greatly devalued .
the majority of localities and units which completed the " three stresses " education in the previous stage have seriously implemented rectification and reform measures and continued to solve problems in a thoroughgoing way , achieving very great success .
in " looking back " it is first necessary to deepen study .
the cpc central committee has issued a series of important instructions on launching the " three stresses " education and consolidating and enlarging its fruits .
the " three stresses " education is self - education in marxism for leading cadres .
" looking back " is a process of study , enhancement , and unification of thinking , and a process of recalling and summing up , squarely facing the deficiencies , and making continuous progress .
generally speaking , closely centering on stressing politics - - the core - - we should focus on enhancing ideological understanding and resolving the existing problems .
in particular , we must thoroughly consider which major problems affecting reform , development , and stability in our own areas and departments need to be resolved .
as regards the existing problems , we must analyze the causes in a truth - seeking way , unfold serious and conscientious criticism and self - criticism , and reach the goal of exchanging thinking , helping and enhancing each other , and promoting work .
" looking back " is a continuation and deepening of the concentrated " three stresses " education .
we must make full use of the successful experiences of the concentrated education , carry forward the party 's work style of linking with reality , keeping in close touch with the masses , and practicing criticism and self - criticism , and be sure to pursue practical results .
chengdu , 16 feb ( xinhua ) - - the lingao nuclear power station in guangdong officially begins operation today after it was checked and accepted by the owner . the sichuan chemical and machinery plant produced the nuclear power station 's key equipment .
an industry source said that operation of the nuclear power plant marks the end of the period in which china was not able to produce key equipment for nuclear power plants .
the successful development and manufacturing of the main ducts has filled the gap in china 's manufacture of nuclear power equipment . it also has an important impact on the development of china 's nuclear power industry in the new century .
it signifies that china has not only brought up a group of engineers and technicians to develop and manufacture nuclear power equipment domestically but has also established a complete set of management models and quality assurance systems that conform to international practice .
nuclear power is one of the universally recognized safe , clean , and highly efficient energy sources .
china had a late start in building nuclear power plants . it has built and put into operation only two power plants , the dayawan and qinshan power plants .
the key equipment in these two plants , the main ducts , were all imported from abroad . the sichuan chemical and machinery plant is the largest manufacturer of oil and chemical machinery in southwest china .
taking advantage of its aod furnace smelting technology and its 20 - year old centrifugal pouring technology , it began to set foot in the manufacture of nuclear power equipment in 1996 .
in june 1999 , in cooperation with a french company , framatome , the plant began to produce the main ducts used in the 1 - mega kilowatt pressurized water reactors . the plant completed the manufacturing of this product last january .

in his speech , yu yongbo highly commended xu zhigong for his significant achievements in learning , studying and propagating deng xiaoping .
at present , reforms of state and military affairs are intensifying and new situations and problems are emerging constantly . therefore we are faced with many heavy tasks .
party committees and political departments at various levels must pay great attention to the study of theory and adopt effective measures to grasp this work in a solid manner .
yu yongbo said : the source of consciousness in studying theory is a firm belief in our ideals .
yu yongbo pointed out : we should effectively implement the " plan for study by military cadres at middle and senior levels . "
while seriously transforming the subjective work , we should strive to employ deng xiaoping theory in making policies and use it to guide our work .
yuan shoufang , deputy director of the general political department , presided over the report meeting .
tang tianbiao and zhang shutian , deputy directors of the general political department as well as more than 300 cadres at divisional or higher level of the organ of the general political department and units directly under the department attended the report meeting .

new york , 15 feb (zxs) - - zhang hongxi , china 's consul general in new york , said the taiwan issue is what all the chinese people are most concerned about .
zhang hongxi made these remarks when he spoke of chinese ambassador li zhaoxing 's reply letter to us senator jesse helms at a spring festival reception he hosted for overseas chinese media in new york .
zhang hongxi said : we have hoped for many years to use the formula of " one country , two systems " to peacefully resolve the taiwan issue .
now , some people , however , are trying to instigate chinese to fight chinese and compel us step by step to use force .
the consul general said : china has implemented the policy of reform and opening up for 20 years , and yet some people in the us congress are still too biased against china .
they turn a blind eye to things that are very obvious , and refuse to comprehend what is transparent to even ordinary people .
further , they always reject our just voice and stand .
they talk about human rights everyday as if the 1.3 billion chinese people do not have a voice . they treat a few criminals as guests of honor and talk at length about what they call " human rights . " should we not give these people a lecture ?
since the report on sentencing hu changqing to death was broadcast by the central television station in its news program yesterday evening , it has become the topic of conversation among people in various localities of the province .
he said that about 1,000 people and reporters attended the trial as observers . besides , a large number of judicial personnel watched the entire process of the trial and sentencing on closed - circuit television . hu changqing got the death sentence he deserved .
when hu changqing was escorted back to prison after the trial yesterday afternoon , a large crowd of people was watching outside the court .
upon learning that hu changqing had been sentenced to death , they all acclaimed the ruling .
the personality said that 13 years ago , former jiangxi governor ni xiance was sentenced to two years ' imprisonment in nanchang for playing favoritism and committing irregularities , and that caused a sensation throughout the country .
today , hu changqing 's case should cause us jiangxi people to think deeply .
beijing , 16 feb (zxs) - - many vicious incidents involving primary and middle school students took place in china on the eve of the chinese lunar new year , causing a shock and concern in the higher echelons of central leadership .
the ministry of education and the offices of renmin ribao and guangming ribao jointly held a forum today to further strengthen and improve education work and do a better job of ideological education among teenagers .
jiang zemin , general secretary of the cpc central committee and other members of the higher echelons of central leadership attached great importance to the incidents and he made an important speech on education work in early february .
in his speech at the forum , vice education minister lu fuyuan said : these incidents seemed to be accidental criminal cases but judged from deeper perspectives , they are the reflection of problems in various fields , such as school education , social education , and home education .
he criticized all sides concerned for laying one - sided stress on knowledge education to the neglect of education in ideology and politics , ethics , discipline , and the legal system .
lu fuyuan said : because china has a big population and factors containing social and economic development are many , employment constitutes a big pressure to society , and this employment pressure has sparked competition in admission into higher schools too early at school .
lu fuyuan expounded in details the six measures to be taken to strengthen education work .
he expressed the hope that all social sectors and departments will care for and participate in , particularly all parents of students will understand and support , education work .
everything looks fresh and gay in the early spring of the year of the dragon , the happy festival time will soon come , and the bright moon is shining in the sky .
this evening [ 16 february ] , the cpc central committee held an evening party at the great hall of the people to celebrate the traditional festival of the chinese nation - - the lantern festival .
colorful streamers decorated the great hall of the people with solemn brilliance this evening .
the evening party was presided over by hu jintao , member of the political bureau 's standing committee of the cpc central committee and vice president of the state .
on behalf of the cpc central committee , he first extended new spring greetings to participants and comrades of intellectual circles and friends in the whole country .
we have won major victories in the three political struggles .
we solemnly held activities to celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of new china , smoothly regained sovereignty over macao , and greatly enhanced all people 's patriotic enthusiasm and confidence in building socialism with chinese characteristics .
the new achievements and victories we achieved last year were embodied with the wisdom and hard work of comrades and friends of intellectual circles .
we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to all those who have made contributions to promoting reform , opening up and the modernization drive .
hu jintao pointed out : the year 2000 is a year of transit into a new century and is also the final year to accomplish the ninth five - year plan , and important fighting goals at the end of the century .
doing well this year 's work is of great significance to realizing our country 's goals of trans - century development .

china has decided to speed up internet development .
while intensifying the construction of major websites , it will strengthen the management of domestic websites so as to ensure the healthy and orderly development of the internet .
domestic websites are required to obtain approval before being registered abroad . there are currently 700 independent websites in china . these websites are of varying types and differ greatly in scale .
what remark has " dumbfounded " helms ?
liu also criticized some us congressmen , saying that their understanding of china " only reaches the level of primary school pupils . "
in his remarks , minister liu expressed the chinese government 's solemn stand on the " taiwan security enhancement act , " which the chinese government made clear through the news media when the bill was approved by the house of representatives .
as for minister liu 's criticism of some us congressmen , he has only pointed out the facts , and there is nothing wrong with that .
for this reason , in his reply li zhaoxing refuted helms ' unreasonable accusations .
li pointed out : " after reviewing the relevant transcripts and notes , i have come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong or inappropriate about minister liu 's remarks at the news conference .
at the news conference , he did remind people of the united states ' decision in 1995 to allow lee teng - hui to visit the united states , which caused relations between the two countries to fall back seriously .
i fully agree with this assessment . "
speaking with the force of justice , ambassador li has fully expressed the stand of the chinese government and people .
ambassador li pointed out : " he ( minister liu xiaoming ) has never compared you and any of your colleagues in congress to 'primary school pupils . '
the nearest comparison i can think of is that , as an american academic put it , even primary school pupils know that taiwan is part of china , but many political figures do not seem to know this truth . "
in fact , a few us congressmen have made some irresponsible remarks about the internal affairs of other countries , but it often happens they do not have even the basic knowledge .
this has aroused the indignation of the chinese people . the chinese diplomat just told the truth and yet helms and his ilk have flown into a rage . this shows that these congressmen are rude and unreasonable and are lacking in upbringing .
even if the senate approves the bill , president clinton has made it clear that he will veto it .
instead of becoming hysterical , it would be better for senator helms to calm down , comprehensively and objectively ponder sino - us relations , and have a better understanding of china 's present conditions .
on 11 february the headquarters for the first time directed the " routine military exercise " of using submarines to block the taiwan strait in the name of " welcoming the vessel . "
chen bingde , commander of the nanjing military region ; tao bojun , commander of the guangzhou military region ; and yang guoliang , commander of the second artillery , will be deputy commanders of the operation .
reportedly , the headquarters will be in charge of commanding all the naval , air , and ground troops stationed in fujian and guangdong , as well as the troops of the second artillery and armed police , until the end of taiwan 's presidential elections in march .
after the spring festival , the pla made use of receiving the modern vessel purchased from russia to dispatch a number of vessels to carry out an exercise aimed at blocking the taiwan strait .
the exercise originally was scheduled for early february . for the sake of letting taiwan residents have a nice spring festival , the vessel had to stay in the pacific ocean for several days and pass through the taiwan strait after the spring festival .
two latest model missile destroyers made by china also joined the " vessel - reception exercise . " equipped with advanced missiles , the vessels have stealth functions . they are the first batch of china - made stealth missile destroyers .
the pla already has delivered large amount of ammunition and transferred large numbers of military vessels to fujian and guangdong . some of the troops in these two provinces already are on level three alert . the troops stationed in the two localities have canceled all leave plans .
the reserve forces at all localities also have started to clean air - raid shelters and examine air - raid facilities .
some of the transport ships and vehicles have been assembled . these ships and vehicles will be used to deliver troops to take part in the " routine military exercises . "
claiming to be denied entry by the hong kong government chen shui - bian also hoped that hong kong would be able to play a more frequent and positive role in cross - strait affairs .
he hoped that the hong kong media present at the interview would make more appeals on this matter .
he believed that it should be up to the people of taiwan , not the president or himself , to decide how cross - strait relations should change , and that the people should decide taiwan 's future course by " public referendum . "
chen shui - bian also disclosed yesterday that the incumbent taiwan vice president and kmt presidential candidate lien chan had asked a businessman to convey his message to beijing that he would withdraw li teng - hui 's " two - state theory " after getting elected .
alleging that lien chan had sent an envoy to beijing chen shui - bian demanded that lien chan clarify this matter to the public , but there was no response from lien chan yesterday .
he also alleged that lien chan had asked a senior kmt adviser to speak to lee teng - hui , asking the latter to give up the post of party chairman .
the party central committee and the state council , attaching great importance to this work , have successively made some important decisions in this regard .
this year , all the fee and fine collecting departments will comprehensively and thoroughly practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
to practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management is conducive to rectifying fiscal and economic order and improving fiscal management .
to practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management is conducive to preventing and correcting corruption at the revenue source , to managing government affairs in accordance with the law and to ensuring impartial law - enforcement .
the judicial organ and the administrative law - enforcement organ shoulder the heavy responsibility of implementing laws and regulations and their basic code of conduct and mandatory requirement are to manage government affairs in accordance with the law and enforce the law impartially .
we should see that there still exist some problems in the practice of " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing the revenues of collected administrative service fees , fines and forfeitures .
some comrades , particularly some comrades of the fee - and fine - collecting departments and agencies , still do not fully understand the importance of practicing " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing the revenues of collected administrative service fees , fines and forfeitures .
in some departments and agencies , the foundation of fiscal management is weak , the fiscal and economic discipline is slack , and the phenomenon of disregarding orders and bans is common .
to solve the aforesaid problems , we should , on the one hand , continue to step up propaganda and education and further strengthen supervision and management , while on the other hand , we should formulate and strictly enforce discipline .
once the work criteria and requirements are clarified , the discipline should keep pace with them . to back an order with law is an important guarantee for practicing " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
to promote comprehensive implementation of the " separation between revenue and expenditure " provisions , it is necessary to enforce discipline , use the discipline as a guarantee , resolutely investigate violators and apply strict disciplinary sanctions against them .
the guangdong ling ao nuclear power station built by the sichuan chemical engineering machinery plant passed a readiness review by the proprietor and shipment was formally started on 16 february .
this marks the end of china 's history of being unable to manufacture trunk line [ zhu guan dao 0031 4619 6670 ] , which is a key component for nuclear power plants .
nuclear power has become one of the safe , clean and highly efficient energy sources universally accepted in the world , and many countries have considered it a key development project .
at present , only the daya bay nuclear power plant and the qinshan nuclear power plant have been built and put into operation .
a concerned person is convinced that importing nuclear power equipment from abroad is too costly and building nuclear power equipment at home will be an important factor in developing nuclear power in china .
the sichuan chemical engineering machinery plant is the largest petrochemical and machinery manufacturing plant in china 's southwest region .
the plant has taken advantage of its own aod furnace technology and the more than 20 years ' experience in centrifugal pouring technology and started to engage in the manufacture of nuclear power equipment in 1996 .
the success in the trial production of the trunk line has filled in our country 's blank in the manufacturing of nuclear power equipment and will have an important impact on china 's development of nuclear power in the new century .
this is china 's only totally domestically produced nuclear power equipment from raw material to finished product . it can save more than $ 20 million for the state in building each nuclear power plant .
besides , a number of chinese engineers and technicians have received training in nuclear power equipment localization and a management and quality guarantee system in line with the international standard has also been established in the course of the production .

vice information lu xinkui of information industry said that structural contradictions have constantly been a major problem affecting the sound development of the information industry .
due to the lack of effective macro - control measures , some localities and departments vied with one another to develop products in great demand ; thus the phenomena of blind investment and redundant construction still survive despite repeated prohibitions .
the information industry should grasp the favorable chance that the state is carrying out the strategy of developing the western areas in a big way to accelerate the pace of developing communication infrastructure facilities and the information industry in the western areas .
the consulate general of the democratic people 's republic of korea [ dprk ] in hong kong was opened officially yesterday .
the office will process business visas and provide information on the dprk to the outside world .
the spokesman said yesterday that the dprk government is very pleased that the chinese government allows it to set up a consulate in hong kong . the consulate general 's key function is to promote economic and cultural exchanges .
the spokesman also expressed hopes that setting up a consulate in hong kong will help the outside world understand more about the dprk .
this is the first time the dprk has set up a diplomatic organization in hong kong .
the consulate can provide business visas . however , hong kong residents who want to tour the dprk still need to apply for a tourist visa through a travel agency , and they must visit the dprk with a tour group .
recently , i have heard a comment : after china 's entry to the world trade organization , its automobile industry will have no prospect and , therefore , can be abandoned .
the automobile industry is a pillar industry , which can motivate and positively affect the technological innovation and development of related industries .
the increase of one unit in the output value of the sedan - making industry can lead to at least a 2.67 - unit increase in the output value of related industries .
in no way can such an industry be abandoned .
the united states is a " country on wheels , " whose economic development is inextricably linked with automobiles .
during the 15 years of japan 's fast economic development , the national economy of that country scored a 36 - fold growth , while the output value of its automobile industry increased 57 times .
in contrast , the british economic status has declined with the dwindling of its automobile industry .
in our country , whether automobiles can get into the chinese families is still a controversial issue , but this is merely a question of time .
sales records of beijing 's major automobile markets show that last year sales of private vehicles accounted for 90 percent of the total sales volume .
as can be seen , abandoning the automobile industry is tantamount to giving this big market to foreign businesses .
is there any prospect of developing china 's automobile industry ? if we develop our automobile industry in the traditional mode of the industrial economy , it has no prospect .
but if we develop it with new ideas and by using new technologies , i think we can open a new way .
in the past , the invention of automobiles certainly brought an earth - shaking change to the world .
the reason for pessimism among some people at present is that they have no confidence in our own technologies .
for instance , some of our science and technology experts once visited our big automobile plants and offered to help develop robots for doing the spot - welding and spray - painting work , but the plant managers said that they would not use china - made robots .
under the new opening condition , of course , we need to acquire technologies from others , but what is more needed is technologies created by ourselves and intellectual property rights that we can use on our own .
without developing our own technologies , we will have no way out .
if we rely solely on imported technologies , we will definitely be lagging behind others . can any foreign company give its key technologies to a competitor ?
we chinese scientists and technicians should launch a struggle : we should get china 's automobile industry involved in international competition .
it is imperative to seize two existing opportunities : one opportunity is that the world is now changing automobiles .
the other is that we have advantages in certain fields .
now , the question of the world is how the world should change automobiles . when it comes to china , the question is how china should change its automobiles .
our first and foremost goal is environmental protection and energy conservation .
with regard to the former , we cannot follow the old track of causing pollution first and correcting the problem later . we should go ahead to develop clean - fuel vehicles .
this should be one of the major directions for changing our automobiles .
in addition to the above , we have to solve the question of safety .
to solve the above - mentioned questions , we should understand the different demands and study china 's automobile market .
we should look into such questions as whether our products made by imported technologies can meet our demands and how to raise our technological level under the guidance of the market .
take air - pollution control in beijing as an example .
if we stipulate that any automobile whose exhaust gas cannot meet the environmental - protection requirement is not allowed to come to beijing , the technological question of how to make the exhaust gas clean will come up .
although automobile manufactures are concerned about money - - they want to do everything possible to save money - - if the state has a law in this respect , the technology for clean exhaust gas will be developed and popularized .
my conclusion is that it can have a way out if it acts on new ideas , think in a new way , and use new and high technologies while taking our national conditions into consideration .
by doing so , it may even lead the world .
china 's automobile industry as a whole is still at a relatively low level , and because of this , it has less problems hindering its development in the new direction .
now that the automobile industry is at a turning point , if we seize the opportunity to go our own way , we may march in the van of the world .
to develop high technologies , we should aim high and have a firm footing .
beijing , 17 february ( xinhua ) - - the supreme people 's procuratorate today publicized the opinions on a three - year procuratorial reform , which aims to boost the procuratorial reform , improve the procuratorial work , perfect the procuratorial system , and strengthen the procuratorial function .
zhang qiong said , it is imperative to reform the supervision systems inside and outside procuratorial organs , and ensure the upholding of justice , honesty , and high efficiency .
to do so , we have to boost the endeavor of " opening the procuratorial work to the public , " and unceasingly broaden the scope and way to do it .
zhang qiong held that procuratorial reform is a long process , and should be conducted in phases and a planned manner , and new reform measures should be adopted only when conditions are ripe .
procuratorial reform is also a profound transformation , involving all the aspects of procuratorial work , and closely related with every procuratorial personnel . the reform calls for innovation in systems as well in concepts .
the concerned expert points out that the state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign capital to the western region .
in the indirect use of foreign capital , the state will divide funds borrowed from foreign governments and international commercial banks into small parts and allocate them to provincial and city governments .
in the direct use of foreign capital , the state will encourage foreign enterprises to make more investments in various fields and set up more joint ventures in the western region .
the state will encourage foreign - capital banks to set up representative offices or operational branches in china 's western region .
the state will permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets to accumulate funds for the construction of infrastructure facilities , such as museum , stadium and other projects of public welfare nature .
the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprise may be expanded .
limits on scale will be removed for a certain period . the state planning commission will administer this work in a strict manner .
the state will try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .
special and favorable consideration will be given to the western region since the competitive power there is inferior to the eastern coastal region .
recently the state development bank has set up branches in lanzhou and urumqi .
to meet the need of the great national strategy of developing the western region , the ministry of communications has made plans to build eight major transportation lines .
the eight major transportation lines are : passages from lanzhou to yunnan , baotou to beihai , xinjiang 's altar to hongqilapu , yinchuan to wuhan , xian to hefei , xining to korla , chongqing to tibet 's zhangmu , and changsha to chongqing .
those projects will be built with state investment and local self - collected funds . construction work will be started in segments in various provinces , autonomous regions , and the municipality . the railways departments will build " three vertical and four horizontal " main lines .
" gas from the western region will be transmitted to the eastern region " to ensure supply for 30 years .
construction work will be done in 10 provinces , autonomous regions and cities .
at present , a section of the main gas pipeline from eastern sichuan to wuhan is being built while an internal transmission network of western oil and natural gas fields is basically operational .
china 's western region has a deposit of 26,000 billion [ er shi liu wan yi 0059 0577 0362 8001 0310 ) cubic meters of natural gas , accounting for more than 86 percent of all land - based natural gas deposits in china .
the total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in china 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .
it has been a fine tradition and political strength of our party to attach great importance to ideological and political work and give full play to its important role in revolution and construction .
in directing china 's revolution and construction , comrades mao zedong and deng xiaoping attached great importance to ideological and political work .
their theory on ideological and political work forms an important part of mao zedong thought and deng xiaoping theory .
as the party 's general secretary , comrade jiang zemin , in light of the new historical conditions , has made many important expositions on how to do good ideological and political work in the new situation .
his expositions on ideological and political work represent his achievements in carrying forward , enriching , and developing the theory by the first and second generations of leadership core on ideological and political work .
studying , researching into , and propagating the expositions by the three generations of party leadership core on ideological and political work is of extremely important significance to strengthening and improving ideological and political work .
as far as its contents are concerned , this book has fully presented the expositions of the three generations of leadership core on ideological and political work as an integrated system .
it provides some important teaching material for the vast number of cadres and masses to study , research into , and propagate the basic theory of our party 's ideological and political work .
the symposium was presided over by guo boxiong , member of the central military commission and executive chief of general staff .
fu quanyou pointed out : combined operations are an natural product of the development of war ; and the combat effectiveness of an army in conducting combined operations has a direct bearing on both the process and the outcome of a war .
today , all countries in the world have laid much stress on the issue of combined operations .
we should adapt ourselves to the development needs of the times , and to changes in the pattern of war ; and conscientiously reinforce our awareness of overall interests , awareness of system , awareness of quality , awareness of information , and awareness of efficiency .
we must establish and perfect a commanding mechanism for combined operations , and ensure a smooth and highly efficient unified command .
meanwhile , we must step up our work in every aspect of the logistics support of our army , so as to lay a sound material foundation for combined operations .
among those attending the symposium were kui fulin and wu quanxu , deputy chiefs of general staff ; zhang li , assistant to chief of general staff ; and cadres at and above the divisional level from the administrative organs of the general staff headquarters .
q : it is reported that us immigration and naturalization service officials currently visiting hong kong said that the united states might grant asylum to " falungong " members from china . what comment do you have on this ?
a : the " falungong " organization is a cult that endangers chinese society and people .
we demand that the us side understand and respect the chinese government 's principled stand on resolving and handling the " falungong " issue , and refrain from doing anything that interferes in china 's internal affairs and from creating new difficulties for sino - us relations .
does china have any comment on the resignation one after the other of the two iraqi - based representatives of international organizations to protest un sanctions against iraq ?
a : china expresses its concern over the resignation of the two high - level iraqi - based officials of international organizations .
china always holds that to ease up the humanitarian difficulty facing the iraqi people , the un " oil for food " program should be earnestly and comprehensively implemented .
however , it is to be regretted that because of the obstruction by one or two countries , the program has not yet been effectively and smoothly carried out .
we urge relevant member states to adopt a constructive and responsible attitude to create conditions for improving the humanitarian situation in iraq .
relevant departments of the chinese government are actively adopting measures to earnestly safeguard network security .
in recent years , computer networks have become an important factor promoting the economic growth of various countries , and the global online business volume already reached $ 102 billion in 1998 .
although china 's internet made a late start , it has developed rapidly . it is estimated that at the end of this year , the number of internet users will reach 16 million and e - commerce will become a hot spot .
this needs a good environment for network development and needs operational security of networks .
in the past few years , hacker incidents have constantly occurred in various parts of the world , and in the beginning of this year , the situation became even worse .
it has been learned that in the united states , network hackers launched attacks to " interrupt the service " of eight well - known websites , including yahoo , amazon.com , and cnn , for three days running , causing economic losses exceeding $ 1.2 billion .
what shocked the computer specialists was that the network hackers were able to organize a large - scale attack on the networks so easily .
for example , on 27 january , hackers invaded into the international travel service vacation website , at which china 's first online tourist auction had just been conducted .
prior to this , police in shanghai arrested a " hacker " with the surname yang for damaging computer information systems .
in recent years , while speeding up the development of the internet , relevant departments in china have energetically adopted effective legal and technological measures to earnestly safeguard the security of networks and to clamp down on network hackers .
as early as in 1997 , china 's ministry of public security promulgated the " procedures for the security protection and management of computer networks and international networks , " which forbid any unit or individual to enter without authorization or to damage computer information networks .
in china 's " criminal law " revised in 1999 , an explicit provision on criminal punishment for the illegal invasion into important areas of computer information systems was added .
although different countries have different ways of management , they share the same goal in strengthening network supervision , that is , to guard against hackers ' interference and damage .
china 's police also recently discovered that some imported computer products lack sound security . under the pretext of " remote maintenance , " security loops are intentionally left behind in these computers for the access of behind - the - scene companies or organizations .
therefore , china 's relevant departments have stipulated that in order to protect national interest and economic security , china 's companies are forbidden to buy products with encryption software designed by foreign countries and no domestic organization or individual shall sell foreign commercial encryption products .
china 's computer security specialists held that only energetically developing the national computer industry , not being technologically controlled by others , and developing domestic computers and software as quickly as possible are effective long - term ways to prevent attacks by foreign hackers and to ensure national security .
he demanded that the us side respect china 's principled stand on this issue and stop interfering in china 's internal affairs .
it is reported that us immigration and naturalization service officials currently visiting hong kong said that the united states might grant asylum to " falungong " members from china .
zhu bangzao once again pointed out seriously : the " falungong " organization is a cult that endangers chinese society and people .
the chinese government 's crackdown on the organization in accordance with the law is aimed at protecting the basic human rights and freedoms of its citizens ; it is also an effective measure to safeguard social stability and to prevent the organization from doing more harm to the public .
he said that the chinese government 's handling of the " falungong " issue had won the firm endorsement and support of people across the country , as well as the understanding of the international community .
recently , the un humanitarian coordinator in iraq tendered his resignation to secretary general kofi annan in protest against the decade - long un sanctions against iraq ; the world food program representative in iraq also announced his resignation for the same reason .
at a foreign ministry news briefing here , zhu bangzao commended their laudable and active efforts in improving the humanitarian situation in iraq during their terms in office .
he said china hopes that the secretary general will name suitable personnel to replace them as soon as possible .
the spokesman said : the chinese side has always maintained that the un " oil - for - food " program should be earnestly and comprehensively implemented , so as to ease the humanitarian difficulties facing the iraqi people .
he pointed out with deep regret that the program had not been effectively and smoothly implemented due to the obstruction of some member states .
zhu bangzao said : china urges relevant member states to adopt a constructive and responsible attitude and create conditions for the improvement of the humanitarian situation in iraq .
beijing , 17 feb (zxs) - - speaking here today , foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao urged the taiwan authorities to hold negotiations with the mainland to end the state of hostility at an early date .
he said that cross - strait dialogue and negotiations on any issue held under the premise of " one country , two systems " would take into full consideration the interests of the people of taiwan and all social sectors .
zhu bangzao once again enunciated the chinese government 's basic principles and positions on the taiwan issue : taiwan is part of chinese territory ; this status cannot be changed .
china 's basic principles on upholding peaceful reunification and " one country , two systems " in resolving the taiwan question have not changed .
the eight - point proposition put forward by jiang zemin in 1995 on developing cross - strait relations and advancing the process of reunifying the motherland through peaceful means has not changed .
he said : at a recent ceremony held by people from all circles in beijing to ceremoniously mark the fifth anniversary of president jiang 's important speech , vice premier qian qichen once again clearly reiterated these principles and expounded them anew .
zhu bangzao pointed out emphatically : china has always maintained that the state of hostility across the taiwan strait should be formally brought to an end through negotiations and under the " one china " principle .
it would be a wise move for taiwan to enter into negotiations with the mainland on this issue at an early date .
the chinese mainland has repeatedly urged the two sides of the taiwan strait to hold dialogue and negotiations on any issue on the basis of the " one china " principle when conditions are ripe .
he said that the interests of the people of taiwan and all social sectors would be taken into full consideration .
having fully grasped the situation , zhu bangzao answered , at today 's news briefing held by the foreign ministry , relevant questions put forward by reporters prior to this .
he said the " sino - us agreement on cooperation in agriculture " is mainly to solve the quarantine issue .
at present , china has started implementing the " agreement . "
in december last year , china 's animal and plant quarantine departments already sent a pre - inspection group to california , florida , and other parts of the united states to pre - inspect oranges in the united states .
beijing , 17 feb ( xinhua ) - - state council premier zhu rongji met with visiting world trade organization (wto) director general mike moore at zhongnanhai this afternoon . they had a deep exchange of views on china 's entry into wto .
zhu rongji first expressed thanks to moore for his energetic efforts for china 's entry into wto .
he said the wto is incomplete without china 's membership .
since china and the united states reached a " win - win " agreement last year , china has held bilateral talks with many other wto members and reached agreement with them .
at present , china is actively holding talks with a small number of remaining members , including the european union (eu) , and the talks are being accelerated .
zhu rongji said that a new round of talks between china and eu will soon be held , and he hoped that during the talks , the two sides can reach consensus and agreement .
moore said china 's entry into the wto will be a historic event .
the day china enters the wto will be a great day to china and the world as a whole .
at present , the wto cannot yet be called a world trade organization .
only after china joins will it be able to really become a world trade organization .
he said that he and his colleagues will try their best to assist china to join the wto as soon as possible , and this will be of great significance to the wto .
moore arrived here at noon today to begin his 3 - day visit at the invitation of foreign trade and economic cooperation minister shi guangsheng .
he will also hold talks with shi guangsheng .
during the meeting , shi guangsheng and vice foreign minister yang wenchang were present .
beijing , 17 feb ( xinhua ) - - a second meeting of the state council on clean and honest administration was held in beijing today .
wei jianxing , li lanqing , qian qichen , wu bangguo , wen jiabao , luo gan , wu yi , ismail amat , and wang zhongyu attended the meeting .
zhu rongji emphatically pointed out that our government is a people 's government , and a clean and honest administration is a minimum requirement for such a government .
he then said that in the past year , governments at various levels have given top priority to the building of a clean and honest administration and the struggle against corruption .
we should keep a clear head , and face the existing problems squarely , we need to fortify our confidence and persevere in carrying out our tasks . we should try to achieve results by stages and push our work forward step by step .
zhu rongji stressed : the central authorities ' fundamental policies for reform and development this year have been clearly set , and concrete arrangements have also been made for the government 's work and tasks .
this is a year at the turn of the century , and it is of great significance for us to carry out our various tasks in reform and development .
the new situation and tasks have put new demands on us in the building of a clean and honest administration and combating corruption .
clean and honest government depends , above all , on self - discipline .
in the spring tide of the market economy , it is all the more necessary for cadres at all levels to be self - restrained , self - disciplined , and self - cautioned and to be able to stand up to the test of various temptations .
they should not only strengthen their self - cultivation and be strictly self - disciplined but also do a good job in controling their family members and relatives as well as those working at their sides .
the central authorities ' " rule for clean and honest government " and other relevant regulations are the code of conduct for government personnel , and they must be implemented to the letter .
second , we should make vigorous efforts to investigate and deal with various cases in the violation of the law and discipline , and concentrate on making breakthroughs in investigating a number of major or serious cases .
all major cases must be thoroughly investigated no matter which departments or persons are involved .
those involved must be unmasked and severely dealt with one by one , and we must not practice favoritism or be soft on them .
third , we should continue to make vigorous efforts to rectify unhealthy tendencies in trades and departments and conscientiously solve outstanding problems about which the masses are concerned with and are strongly object to .
we should continue to screen and put an end to the malpractices of wantonly collecting fees from , indiscriminately imposing fines on , and arbitrarily apportioning expenses among peasants and enterprises .
we should resolutely stop various activities to compare with one another in reaching certain standards .
we should vigorously rectify unhealthy tendencies in the buying and selling of medicines , ensure that the medicines taken by the masses are safe and efficacious , and reduce the irrational burdens on the state and the masses .
we should continue to solve the problem of arbitrarily collecting fees by primary and middle schools and other educational institutions in order to lighten the burden on the masses .
fourth , it is necessary to be diligent , practice strict economy , and combat waste .
we should conscientiously enforce the central authorities ' " regulations on practicing strict economy and stopping luxury and waste by party and government organs . "
this year , we should step up our efforts to investigate and deal with cases in this regard ; we should seize on typical cases , deal with them severely , and make them known to the public .
we should make efforts to cut the number of meetings and documents to the minimum .
fifth , it is necessary to carry out reform in depth , to strengthen the supervisory and restraining mechanisms , and to prevent corruption at its source .
we should continue the reform of government institutions and further change government functions .
we should establish an administrative system and working mechanism marked by high efficiency , coordinated operations , and standard behavior .
governments and their personnel at various levels must perform their duties within the limits of authorities permitted by the law and in strict accordance with legal procedures , and those who neglect their duties or abuse their power must be investigated .
zhu rongji stressed : departments and governments at all levels should actually take on their responsibilities and strengthen their leadership over the efforts to build a clean and honest administration and combat corruption .
zhu rongji pointed out : departments under the party central committee and the state council should set higher standards and stricter demands in building a clean and honest administration and combating corruption in order to set an example for government organs at various levels .
we should further consolidate and deepen the results of the " three stresses " education , conscientiously carry out rectification and reform measures , and continue to step up the efforts to build a clean and honest administration .
zhu rongji called on governments and developments at all levels to actively support the work of the supervision and auditing departments by creating better working conditions for them .
the supervision and auditing departments should adhere to principles , have the courage to crack the hard cases , are not afraid of offending people , and continue to improve their work .
leaders of various ministries , commissions , organs directly under the state council , and working bodies and institutions under the state council , as well as state bureaus under ministries or commissions and other relevant units , attended the meeting .
responsible officials of the ministry of supervision , the ministry of finance , the ministry of construction , the state pharmaceutical supervision and administration , the general administration of customs , and the state economic and trade commission separately spoke at the meeting .
responsible officials of the central discipline inspection commission , the supreme people 's court , and the supreme people 's procuratorate , as well as of the central committees of various democratic parties and the all - china association of industry and commerce , attended the meeting on invitation .
beijing , 17 feb ( xinhua news agency ) - - " mao zedong , deng xiaoping , jiang zemin on ideological and political work , " a book compiled by the propaganda department of the cpc central committee , has now been officially published for distribution .
setting great store by ideological and political work and giving full play to the important role of ideological and political work in revolution and construction has been our party 's fine tradition and political advantage .
through age - long revolution and construction , our party has accumulated rich experience in ideological and political work .
" mao zedong , deng xiaoping , jiang zemin on ideological and political work " is a concentrated embodiment of the basic theories and basic experiences of our party 's ideological and political work .
the theories of mao zedong and deng xiaoping on ideological and political work are important components of mao zedong thought and deng xiaoping theory .
comrade jiang zemin 's expositions on ideological and political work represent a continuation , enrichment , and development of the theories on ideological and political work created by the party 's first and second - generation leadership nuclei .
they are crystallizations of the wisdom of the entire party , are valuable ideological assets , and are powerful theoretical weapons and important guidelines with which we can strengthen and improve ideological work at present .
this is our honorable mission and sacred duty .
the key to studying and publicizing the expositions made by the three generations of leadership nuclei of our party on ideological and political work is to further enhance the understanding of the importance of ideological and political work .
the party 's leadership nuclei across three generations gave very brilliant expositions on the status and function of ideological and political work .
they conclude , in a nutshell , that maintaining ideological education is a central link in the process of uniting the whole party in a great struggle ; ideological and political work is a lifeline for economic work and all other work .
this is a truth that has been validated time and time again by the party 's history of struggle , especially the practice of reform and opening up .
if we failed to keep a firm grip on this important piece of work that concerns the future and destiny of the party and the country in a conscientious way , we would commit unforgivable historical mistakes .
studying and publicizing the expositions made by the three generations of leadership nuclei of our party on ideological and political work requires us to study new circumstances , solve new problems , and actively explore the laws and methods regarding ideological and political work under the new circumstances .
this is an important idea that all three generations of leadership nuclei of the party have had regarding ideological and political work and also an important and urgent project facing our comrades across the whole party . we must make strenuous efforts to solve well this issue .
the tasks are very arduous . to unify thinking , bring people 's hearts and minds together , boost the morale , and arouse the enthusiasm and creativity of the people depends on our work , especially ideological and political work .
we can see that inspired by the spirit of the important instructions made by comrade jiang zemin on propaganda and ideological work , our ideological and political work is showing a positive momentum of development .
the publication of the book , " mao zedong , deng xiaoping , jiang zemin on ideological and political work , " is set to inject great vitality into the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work .
newly elected croatian president mesic said in zagreb on 17 february that new croatian leaders will continue to pursue the one china policy and develop friendly cooperative ties with china .
mesic made those comments when meeting zhu lilan , special envoy of the chinese government and minister of science and technology , and her entourage .
mesic spoke highly of china 's economic achievements .
the same day new speaker of parliament zlatko tomcic also met the delegation of the chinese government .
tomcic noted that despite changes in its leadership after the parliamentary and presidential elections , croatia will continue to recognize that taiwan is an inalienable part of china .
on behalf of state president jiang zemin , national people 's congress chairman li peng , and premier zhu rongji , envoy zhu lilan extended her regards to croatian leaders .
that day she also held talks with hrvoje kraljevic , croatian minister of science and technology . the chinese government delegation led by zhu lilan arrived in zagreb on the afternoon of 16 february and will attend president mesic 's inauguration on 18 february .
croatia 's parliamentary and presidential elections were held in january and february this year , respectively .
the spokesman made the above - mentioned remarks while answering a reporter 's question on cross - strait ties .
zhu bangzhao stressed that taiwan is part of china 's territory and that this cannot be changed .
our basic principle on persisting in peaceful reunification and " one country , two systems " for solving the taiwan issue has remained unchanged .
it is generally believed that economic issues will be put at the top of the agenda for the third plenary session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] next month .
there are concerns over whether state councilors will be changed and whether there will be any replacement for the late npc vice chairman , xie fei , and cheng kejie , who is under investigation for bribery .
after institutional reform in 1998 , state council ministries and commissions , notably the setc , have attracted much attention .
the new setc is also known as " a small state council " since its functions cover that of the former state council production office and other ministerial bodies for internal trade and metallurgical , chemical , coal , petrochemical , and textile industries .
when zhu rongji unveiled his cabinet , sheng huaren , then president of the china petrochemical corporation , was unexpectedly named setc minister .
sheng huaren advanced in years ; his achievements mediocre a source familiar with sheng huaren said that a diligent and conscientious official , sheng has a reputation of being an " old ox " of the setc .
sources revealed that sdpc vice minister li rongrong will replace sheng huaren after his recent transfer to the position of setc vice minister .
li rongrong , who is in his early fifties , was the setc vice minister and secretary general before the reshuffle .
his transfer may well be termed " the resumption of his old profession .
" concerns over vacant positions of npc vice chairmen two vice chairmen positions are vacant after npc vice chairman xie fei died of illness and another vice chairman , cheng kejie , was placed under investigation for bribery .
there are concerns over whether the forthcoming npc session will announce and explain cheng kejie 's case .
sources recently said that the political bureau would be augmented next month by zeng qinghong , alternate member of the cpc central political bureau and head of the central propaganda department , who may also succeed xie fei as npc vice chairman .
in addition , sources did not rule out the possibility that state councilors and even vice premiers would be augmented , but that the personnel changes had not been confirmed .
some time ago , rumor had it that guangdong party secretary li changchun would be transferred to the central government as vice premier . earlier , there were similar rumors about shanghai party secretary huang ju .
li and huang have long been regarded as members of the fourth - generation cpc leadership . their transfer to beijing is just a matter of time , but whether the pair will be transferred at this year 's npc session remains to be seen .
when cable and wireless officially notified hong kong telecom on 24 january that it was negotiating with singapore telecom on merging the latter two , the market was not at all surprised at the merger .
yesterday , a third party suddenly appeared in the negotiations and it is said that there is a story behind the merge .
reportedly , beijing did not give them an immediate response .
if uk cable and wireless is willing to sell hong kong telecom , there are several consortia in hong kong that are capable of taking over hong kong telecom . hence , they indirectly voiced their opposition to the merger between singapore telecom and hong kong telecom .
reportedly , against the aforementioned background , news spread yesterday that cheung kong holdings , hutchison whampoa , and pacific cent cyber planned to buy hong kong telecom .
president ben ali asked tang jiaxuan to communicate his cordial regards to president jiang zemin .
ben ali indicated that the relationship between tunisia and china is very good . he expressed gratitude to the chinese government for its assistance to tunisia 's economic construction .
tunisia highly appreciated the domestic and foreign policies that the chinese leaders have pursued and deeply admired china 's achievements in economic and social development .
since tunisia is an incumbent nonpermanent member of the un security council , china is willing to strengthen consultations with tunisia and to work together with tunisia to safeguard the rights and benefits of developing countries .
ben ali said that china has a population of 1.2 billion . china has done a good job in resolving food , housing , transportation , and educational problems for the people , thus embodying its endeavors to respect the human rights .
tunisia opposes the enforcement of dual standards on the issue of human rights .
at the invitation of tunisian foreign minister yahia , tang jiaxuan arrived in tunisia on the evening of 16 february to begin his three - day visit to tunisia .
on 17 february , he held talks with yahia on further developing the bilateral ties and the issues of common concern .
tang jiaxuan expressed gratitude to tunisia for its understanding and support of china 's great cause of national reunification and the human rights issue .
tang jiaxuan stressed that the chinese government pays attention to promoting and safeguarding the human rights and basic freedom .
at present , china is in the best historical era in terms of the human rights situation .
facts prove that dialogues are better than confrontation .
as for the developing countries , the rights to survival and development are the highest human rights .
yahia indicated that tunisia shares identical and similar views with china on the issue of human rights . tunisia maintains that the human rights issue is related to many aspects , such as politics , the economy , and culture , primarily the rights to survival and development .
tunisia has consistently opposed the practice of seeing the human rights issue as a means for bringing pressure to bear on other countries . we support china 's stand and proposition on the human rights issue at the un human rights conference and on all kinds of international occasions .
after the meeting , the foreign ministers of the two countries attended the ceremony to sign the agreement on the sino - tunisian economic and technological cooperation .
lu guozeng , chinese ambassador to tunisia ; and kaili [ name as transliterated ] . director of the asia department under the tunisian ministry of foreign affairs , signed the agreement on behalf of their governments , respectively .
like arrows darting away from bowstrings , the missile launching operators , in full battle array , swiftly drew themselves into their combat positions upon the issuance of an order from the commander , " the antitank missile detachment launches an attack ! "
" missile erection is ready !
leveling of aiming sight is ready ! "
" goal testing is ready .. "
" fire ! "
one could only see that a missile launcher pressed a red button lightly with his index finger , and immediately , with the sound of a whistle , a " hongjian [ red arrow ] " rose high into the air dragging a fresh red licking flame .
what to meet one 's eye was a missile penetrating the " heart " of the goal after the missile drew a beautiful curve in the sky .
closely followed were two missiles launched , which , to one 's surprise , ran successively through a same bullet hole .
on the field , the astonished crowd burst into thunderous applause at once .
li bin , a missile launcher , is quite a typical example .
he systematically " filled " his brain with the knowledge of the missiles ' function , the theory of aviation control , and others , and became a " missile expert " in reality as well as in name .
until now , he has launched 16 antitank missiles , with a marvelous shooting average of 100 percent , enough to be compared favorably with the students majoring in antitank missile command .
in the missile company , there are plenty of expert soldiers like li bin who enjoy such good names as " miracle - working doctor of missiles , " " a wonder shooter of missiles , " " artillery expert , " and others .
however , there is only one final goal : searching for a wonder - working magic to win the victory over the enemy .
with a sense of humor , the soldiers said : it is our unique technique to conduct " guerrilla warfare " by using modern weaponry .
as stipulated , a soldier needs to master only two of these weapons .
how could such a small detachment achieve so many tops ?
the training method was strongly opposed by experts when first proposed .
with repeated training of more than 1,000 times , the officers and men finally mastered the unique technique .
the " crash training method , " " maximum training method , " " psychological disposition training method , " and " anti - interference training method " and other new methods of training launchers originated by the soldiers of the company have been promoted among units .
the ballistic curve has left a mark , and the accuracy of the trajectory has recorded the hardships and brilliance of the missile company .
china is a big developing country whose economy is undergoing the process of changing tracks , and the economic growth in china has a very close relationship with the economic structure and adjustment .
therefore , the structure - related policies can be regarded as the core policies of economic growth in china .
after entering the year 2000 , what contradictions have emerged in china 's economic structure ? i should like to take this opportunity to advance my own views on two issues .
one is the current contradictions in china 's economic structure that i summed up in brief , and the other is some policy - related suggestions that i made .
first , let me present my views on the first issue .
comparing 1998 with 1990 , the proportion of the secondary industry rose from 41.6 percent to 55.6 percent , of which the proportion of industry rose from 37 percent to 51 percent , increasing by a big margin that was seldom seen before .
if we make a comparison of different countries in the world , we will find that the current proportion of china 's service industry is lower by about 10 percentage points than that of the low - income countries .
second , it is owing to the incorrect discrimination and prejudice against the service industry as well as the deep - rooted ideas that " a country cannot be prosperous without industry " and " the development of the service industry cannot deviate from the development of industry . "
this kind of discrimination and prejudice stems from the self - sustaining economy or feudal ideology rather than the concept of division of labor , which in essence runs counter to marketization .
imbalance in the proportion of urban and rural population [ subhead ] the second prominent contradiction in the economic structure at present is the imbalance in the proportion of urban and rural population and the extremely low ratio of urbanization .
although we have reached a basic consensus on further urban development , still the problem has not been resolved .
the present proposition is to turn the agricultural population into urban population . however , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .
the genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .
the essence of readjusting the urban and rural population structure lies in forming a new mechanism and striving to create an appealing urban economy based on marketization , rather than simplistically building a number of new cities .
very obviously , as a result of this process , a number of cities will come into being .
irrational enterprise management structure [ subhead ] the third structural contradiction is shown in the social infrastructure , particularly in the supply of public goods , which is seriously lagging behind .
another example , the civilian - run economy is now gradually playing the guiding role in the economic growth as a whole , but the structure and system still have partiality for the morbid state - owned sectors .
besides , residents are now changing from passive depositors to active investors , but the capital market lacks a series of coordinated rules and regulations .
what is more , china 's economy is confronted with the impacts from the global integration and network society , but at present all kinds of rules are seriously unsuitable to this situation .
in short , the shortage of public goods supply and the government 's functions being out of place are perhaps the core problems of the numerous structural contradictions .
the fourth structural contradiction is manifested in the fact that the company and enterprise management structural reform are not in place .
there is a very definite relationship between the company 's management structure and growth , because the investors ' confidence will not be strengthened unless there is a sound company management structure .
second , the agent 's incentive mechanism is not linked to the proprietary right , which has led to a series of short - term behaviors .
suggestions on structural adjustment [ subhead ] second , this is about the way of thinking and the orientation of policies for further formulating the structural adjustment policies . taken as a whole , the aforementioned structural adjustment policies are matters relating to further reform .
hence , the structural adjustment in the next step is , in essence , the institutional adjustment .
since time is limited , i think i will lay stress on the following four problems .
first , the most direct goal of making structural adjustment is to bring china 's economy back to the normal orbit of growth as quickly as possible .
that is why structural adjustment should be closely combined with the goal of growth .
second , when we consider how to set the structural adjustment policies , we should conform to the general trends , including the globalization trend , china 's economic internationalization trend , marketization trend , and urbanization trend .
third , a major precondition of this adjustment is the division of labor between the government and the markets in terms of functions and roles , and what the government should do must be clearly defined .
the central and local governments ' powers in office should be reasonably differentiated so that they will not intervene in the normal operations of the market mechanism .
fourth , a direct starting point for carrying out the adjustment policies is to continue the reform of the government .
it goes without saying that in the course of china 's economic structural adjustment , we will also touch upon a lot of concrete policies , but i think , perhaps , priority should be given to the aforementioned four aspects .
for example , unlike the consumer - oriented value - added taxes levied by most countries , china opted for production - oriented value - added taxes , causing the actual tax burden on investment to be quite heavy .
moreover , china instituted land value - added taxes and regulatory taxes on investment in fixed assets , with a view to reining in overheating in investment through tax regulation .
as a deflationary trend has arisen in china , however , jump - starting investment has become a top priority .
to this end , relevant authorities have decided to stop collecting regulatory taxes on investment in fixed assets this year .
moreover , in terms of the direction of reform , relevant authorities are considering converting production - oriented value - added taxes into consumer - oriented value - added taxes .
financial constraints , however , require a step - by - step approach toward exploring relevant adjustments and reforms in this respect .
taxation departments have already taken initial actions in those sectors whose incomes will not suffer greatly as a result of such actions .
relevant personnel said : china 's mid - term goal is to raise the proportion of its tax revenue to its gross domestic product to the average level of developing countries .
as this proportion is still relatively small , china cannot implement a tax - reduction policy . however , it can introduce structural adjustments to its tax policy while ensuring steady growth in tax revenue - - that is , collecting and cutting taxes as necessary .
as china 's accession to the world trade organization draws near , the pressure of accession has become a driving force for further reforming and improving the tax system .
the new trends of development in the international economy are compelling china to adjust its tax system .
the two most compelling trends are the expansion of multinational operations and the growth of electronic commerce .
relevant personnel agreed that china 's current tax system is incompatible with these new trends and that efforts must be stepped up to study measures for coping with these trends .
although china has adopted some measures in accordance with the demands of the international and domestic economic environments for changes to its tax system , it must proceed prudently with overall tax reform .
on 17 january this year , a student at zhejiang jinhua city no.4 high school beat his mother to death because of his academic results and parental pressure .
although this is an extreme case in a tiny minority , it is sufficient to show : reducing the heavy academic burden on students and fostering their fine psychological quality and legal concepts are a pressing task .
since the prc 's founding , the party and government have all along attached great importance to the healthy growth of primary and secondary school students and have time and again checked the bad practice of increasing the burden on students .
the three generations of the party leadership cores , mao zedong , deng xiaoping , and jiang zemin , have issued important instructions on this aspect .
the heavy burden on primary and secondary school students is a chronic problem in china 's education and an obstacle to teenagers ' healthy growth .
though measures have been taken for many years , it is still difficult to implement " burden reduction . " the burden on students has been increasing instead of being eased , for which there are many reasons .
hence , " the heavy burden on students " is not only an education problem but also a social issue .
in recent years , various localities have had many successful experiences .
meanwhile , some schools have taken psychological health education as an important part of quality education to help students allay their worries in the process of their growth and to raise their psychological and moral quality .
these examples of effectively reducing students ' burden and helping them establish a correct outlook on the world and life and values have boosted our confidence in overcoming the chronic problem of " burden reduction . "
reducing students ' academic , economic , and psychological burden is not only a pressing task at present but also a long - term strategic mission .
the education department , the entire party , and the whole society should make joint efforts to strengthen management and adopt feasible measures to strive for practical results .
we should educate cadres , headmasters , teachers , and parents to establish correct outlooks on education , quality , and talent so that the comprehensive implementation of quality education and the enhancement of education quality will become a society - wide consensus .
we should speed up the reform of the course system , structure , and content of primary and secondary schools and set up a new curriculum system compatible with social development .
it is also necessary to further reform the entrance examination system and promptly establish entrance examination and education appraisal systems that meet the requirements of quality education .
some parents are worried that teaching quality will be lowered if students ' academic burden is lightened . hence , they hire tutors and give school assignments to increase their children 's burden after schools adopt " burden reduction " measures .
as a matter of fact , there is no positive connection between " burden reduction " and lowered teaching quality . instead , the purpose of " burden reduction " is to raise education quality .
therefore , parents should acquire a correct outlook on education quality , support school measures for " burden reduction , " and help schools genuinely ease the heavy burden on children .
doing a good job in easing students ' heavy burden has a direct bearing on the comprehensive promotion of quality education , on the healthy growth of the younger generation , and on the position of the chinese nation in international competition in the 21st century .
in the spirit of being highly responsible for the future of the nation , we should make concerted efforts to do solid work in order to achieve practical results in reducing students ' heavy burden .
we should also strive to train and bring up morally , intellectually , and physically well - developed socialist builders and successors of " ideals , morality , culture , and discipline " with an enterprising spirit and practical capabilities .
shi guangsheng briefed moore on the progress in negotiations on china 's accession to the wto .
he said : following the conclusion of the sino - us bilateral agreement , the process of negotiations between china and other wto members has accelerated noticeably .
china recently signed yet another set of bilateral agreements with several wto members , and is intensifying negotiations with a few other wto members , including the european union , that have sought negotiations with it .
shi guangsheng said : after joining the wto , china , as a large country that acts responsibly , will fulfill its obligations , observe wto rules , and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements while enjoying relevant rights as a wto member .
he said : accession to the wto will bring both opportunities and challenges to china .
he said that china 's accession to the wto would benefit china , other countries in the world , and the wto itself .
he said that his goal is clear , and he hoped china would become a wto member at an early date , so that the wto would become a global trading body in the true sense .
at the invitation of shi guangsheng , moore arrived here on 17 february for a three - day visit .
vice foreign minister yang jiechi and us ambassador to china joseph prueher were present at the meeting .
sino - us relations experienced substantial twists and turns last year .
thanks to the joint efforts of their leaders and governments , china and the united states restored and developed their relations , especially after the meeting between president jiang zemin and president clinton in auckland .
sino - us relations are now faced with opportunities for further improvement and development . there are also challenges .
we are willing to work with the us side to advance sino - us relations in the direction defined by the presidents of the two countries and toward the goal established by them .
vice premier qian emphatically pointed out : the taiwan issue has always been the most important and the most sensitive issue at the core of sino - us relations .
we hope that the us side will abide by the three sino - us joint communiques and relevant commitments and properly handle the taiwan issue .
deputy secretary of state talbott said : the clinton administration is committed to the development of us - china relations .
president clinton is determined to further promote us - china relations along the lines of a constructive strategic partnership in the remaining months of his tenure .
president clinton is firmly committed to urging the us congress to support permanent normal trade relations with china .
talbott said that the us government opposes the taiwan security enhancement act and will prevent it from becoming law .
beijing , 18 feb (zxs) - - central military commission vice chairman zhang wannian met with deputy secretary of state strobe talbott , us undersecretary of defense walter slocombe , and vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joseph ralston today .
the two sides talked about the restoration of exchanges and the development of the relations between the chinese and us armed forces .
zhang wannian specially elaborated clearly china 's stand on the taiwan issue , including the issue of us arms sales to taiwan .
both sides held that china and the united states undertake special responsibility in safeguarding world and regional peace , stability , and security .
both sides expressed the necessity of increasing contacts , enhancing understanding , expanding consensus , and promoting cooperation .
the chinese side pointed out that the development and deployment of national and theater missile defense systems are not conducive to the global strategic balance and not conducive to regional peace and stability .
it hoped the us side will respect the universal desire of the international community , act prudently , and make wise decisions .
" the day when china joins the wto will be an important day . "
moore expressed the hope that the day will come early .
moore , 51 , became the director general of the wto on 1 september last year .
before that , he was the prime minister , associate minister of foreign affairs and trade , and minister of foreign affairs and trade of new zealand .
he was elected member of new zealand 's parliament at 23 and was the youngest member of the parliament in new zealand 's history .
during his three - day visit to china , his main purpose is to look into the remaining obstacles to china 's accession to the wto , so that he can coordinate all parties concerned to accelerate the process of china 's accession .
following his exchange of views with premier zhu rongji yesterday , this morning he held talks with shi guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation .
moore said he was optimistic about china 's accession to the wto within this year .
he said : " chinese leaders are determined to join the wto and people of the wto are also very enthusiastic about this .
china 's becoming a member of the wto will benefit china as well as other countries .
china 's accession to the wto will have great significance and will be a very important event .
we expect that china will become a member of the wto within this year and this also is the goal of our efforts . "
he also said that , to join the wto , china still needs to hold talks with eu , mexico , and other members of the wto .
he said , currently , all parties concerned hope that a final decision will be made within this year on china 's accession to the wto , and the secretariat of the wto will do its best to accelerate the consultative process .
moore took note of the opportunities and difficulties china will face after it joins the wto as a developing country .
he said : after china joins the wto , it will have more development opportunities , and development will bring prosperity and peace .
but , after china 's accession to the wto , its problems will not disappear . china 's state - owned enterprises need to enhance their competitiveness and some industries will face competitions .
similar problems exist in every country , including developed countries .
he expressed the belief that , with the chinese people 's wisdom and industriousness , china 's future is bright .
moore said , after china 's accession to the wto , it will fuse itself into an increasingly tightly - bound world , and this will bring economic prosperity and make china safer .
he said " this is an economic issue and more a development issue . "
recalling his first visit to china in 1986 , moore said , comparing with 1986 , beijing now is a completely different city , and , for china , the past two decades were two decades of success .
according to cao siyuan , china 's accession to the wto will bring about five big changes : 1 .
promotion of trade liberalization after its entry to the wto , china and the more than 130 wto members will give each other favorable treatment in terms of trade .
it will gradually reduce its tariff rates and remove non - tariff barriers .
promotion of investment liberalization the wto wants to break down not only trade barriers , but also investment barriers .
after our accession to the wto , the wto 's operational rules will be applicable to china , and it must ask us to radically improve our environment for investment .
this will open a wide space for soliciting foreign investment .
this will enormously increase the total amount of foreign capital introduced into this country , hopefully from 1998 's $ 45 billion to $ 100 billion in 2005 . 3 .
promotion of market competition after china 's entry to the wto , both import and export barriers have to be removed .
put another way , we must , as a first step , eliminate our domestic trade blockade between different localities so as to cope with the more forceful external competition pressure we will be confronted with after joining the wto .
however , it is only this pressure that can sharpen the competitive edge of chinese enterprises and china - made products . we often say that we should boost china 's overall national strength .
the overall strength of a country is most primarily manifested by the competitiveness of its enterprises and products .
the competitiveness of enterprises and products , the fine product quality and low prices , and the big market enjoyed by the products represent the most important overall strength of a country .
promotion of all - round reform after its entry to the wto , china will fully converge with the rest of the world to make joint efforts toward creating and sharing a new civilization on the globe .
such a full - scale convergence will surely prompt china to launch an all - round reform .
the most cardinal effect of this convergence is that it will trigger our demand for further reforming the economic structure , government administration , and the entire political system . 5 .
promotion of improvement of people 's living standard the direct beneficiary of china 's entry to the wto is , of course , the broad masses of consumers .
the lowering of tariff rates will lead to a lower price level , either directly or indirectly , thus raising the purchasing power of the money in the hands of consumers .
the circular emphasizes : great efforts should be made to facilitate the process of distribution of graduate resources according to market demand and strive to establish a graduate employment system that suits the socialist market economy system .
we should guide the graduates to find jobs in the personnel market and ensure they are employed more rapidly .
localities and departments where conditions permit should actively and steadily promote the method of no guaranteed employment and should gradually establish a new mechanism for placing the graduates , which suits the characteristics of personnel distribution and flow under the condition of the market economy .
the circular urges : continued efforts should be made to select graduates of schools of higher learning to work in rural areas and in grass - roots public security departments .
when employing the graduates , state administrative organs at all levels should strictly implement the " interim regulations on state public servants " and persist in employment through examination .
western regions should seize the opportunity presented by implementation of the strategy of large - scale development of western regions and formulate encouraging policies to guide the graduates to work in these regions in line with the development priorities determined by the state .
the circular urges : personnel departments at all levels should give full play to the role of their subordinate personnel markets to provide good - quality service to the graduates .
they should strictly investigate and deal with all fraud in employment that aims at profit making .
they should extend the period for the graduates to choose their own jobs in line with the spirit of relevant state regulations .
personnel service institutions under government personnel departments at and above the county level should serve as a personnel agent for the graduates who return to their native towns without having jobs determined , so that these graduates still can choose their own jobs through the personnel market .
the circular emphasizes : personnel departments at all levels should attach great importance to the employment of graduates , seriously analyze the local situation in this work , and study and resolve new conditions and problems in a timely manner so as to make the work successful .
they should make work procedures public and simplify the procedures for examination and approval to raise work efficiency .
they should actively coordinate with relevant departments to explore and establish the social security system for unemployment insurance and medical service that are closely related with the employment of graduates , so that a realistic and effective guarantee can be provided for the employment of graduates .
personnel departments at all levels should also coordinate and cooperate with education , planning , finance , public security , and grain departments to ensure the smooth progress in the employment of graduates .
guangdong province has made unremitting efforts to investigate and handle large and serious cases .
wang huayuan said : this year guangdong 's discipline inspection and supervision departments will continue to regard investigation of large and serious cases as the priority of the anticorruption work .
they will lay emphasis on investigating and handling the law and discipline violations committed by party and government leading organs , administrative law - enforcement organs , judicial organs , economic management departments , and leading cadres at and above the county ( section ) level .
following the precedent of last year 's sessions , which were short and streamlined , this year 's npc session and cppcc national committee sessions will also last only 10 days and will end on 13 march and 15 march , respectively .
agenda setting , media coverage , and other preparatory work are being made in an intense but orderly way , according to a relevant source .
according to established practice , the heads of the state council and its subordinate departments regularly deliver reports to the npc deputies on the their respective departments ' work conducted in the preceding year .
in the case of the npc standing committee , however , it is the vice chairman who delivers the report , while the chairman presides over the session .
vice chairman tian jiyun has always delivered the work report , while chairman qiao shi presided over the sessions .
at the second session of the ninth npc , vice chairman jiang chunyun delivered the npc standing committee report , while chairman li peng presided over the session .
this year 's 30 january marks the fifth anniversary of the publication of president jiang zemin 's important speech " continue to strive to promote the accomplishment of the great cause of the reunification of the motherland . "
president jiang forwarded an eight - point proposal for developing cross - strait relations in the current stage and for advancing the process of reunifying the motherland through peaceful means .
i resolutely support the eight - point proposal and firmly believe that the complete reunification of the motherland will be achieved .
as we enter the new millenium , it is necessary for us to review the process of history .
beginning from mid and later parts of 1950s , in coordination with china 's socialist construction , we forwarded the proposal of " liberate taiwan through peaceful means . "
in june 1983 , mr. deng xiaoping proposed six concepts on taiwan policy for achieving the motherland 's peaceful reunification , making the concept of " one country , two systems " more specific and systematic .
in the past half century , the chinese government and people have made relentless efforts for ending the state of hostile separation between the two sides of the taiwan strait and for accomplishing the great cause of the motherland 's reunification .
president jiang 's speech again reiterated the hope of settling the taiwan issue through peaceful means and implementing two systems for one country , that is , the " one country , two systems " concept .
the smooth reversion of hong kong and macao should be a mirror . the confidence of hong kong and macao compatriots has been enhanced tremendously compared to that in 1996 .
there is only one china in the world , and taiwan is part of china . the chinese territory and sovereignty is indivisible .
now taiwan 's mainstream public opinion is to maintain the cross - strait interaction situation and peaceful reunification .
compatriots on the two sides of the taiwan strait are both chinese people with the same roots and ancestors . just like solving different opinions within a family , it is better to resolve them by peaceful means as early as possible .
luo gan pointed out : serving the people heart and soul has all along remained our party 's aim .
we must conscientiously solve such a fundamental question as " whose interests we represent , " namely , for whom we exercise power and enforce the law , in accordance with general secretary jiang zemin 's requirement of " strict law enforcement and warm service . "
we should constantly reform and perfect the courts ' judicial work , personnel work system , and operational procedures in accordance with the provisions of our constitution and laws and ensure judicial impartiality by virtue of the laws and systems .
we should dare to eliminate all sorts of interference ; overcome local protectionism and departmental protectionism ; unswervingly safeguard the authority of our constitution and laws ; and safeguard the unity of our country 's rule of law .
only by so doing will we be able to cultivate in the heart of the people and masses such a fine image that the people 's courts and people 's judges impartially enforce the law ; handle cases in a civilized way ; and warmly offer services .
for many developing countries , inequality and aggravation of poverty marked the past 10 years .
due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the south and the north .
according to a statistical report , the number of the most undeveloped countries has increased from 29 in 1976 to 48 at present .
in order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .
looking at the problem from a historical point of view , the developed countries have the responsibility and obligation to provide aid to those developing countries .
at present , developing countries are mostly former colonies or semi - colonies . the poverty and backwardness of those countries now are the results of cruel exploitation by their suzerains .
it can be said that without frenzied plundering in earlier years , developed countries could not have been so prosperous today .
therefore , the united nations has stipulated that developed countries must use 0.7 percent of their gnp for " development aid " each year .
however , the actual situation is that the development aid is not satisfactory in amount , content , and types .
first of all , the developed countries ' aid has not reached the standard of 0.7 percent of their gnp , and the amount has been decreasing in recent years .
since the 1990s , the official aid from developed countries to the most undeveloped countries has been reduced by 23 percent .
owing to inadequate funds , those development aids can only be used to cover the deficits of the most undeveloped countries and cannot be truly used for development .
besides , in providing aid , western countries often put forward many harsh terms on democratization , political system , judicial independence and human rights issues . sometimes , those countries even clearly limit the use of funds .
this kind of practice of " meddling in others ' affairs " not only will be suspected of interfering in internal affairs of other countries , but will often be divorced from the national situation of receiving countries or even bring disasters to receiving countries .
according to a statistical report , due to unfair trade , labor service , and the financial system in the world today , the losses to developing countries are as high as $ 500 billion each year , or ten times the amount of aid received by developing countries .
of course , in the face of future challenges , developing countries should also look reality in the face , strengthen internal unity , give full play to their own advantages , and accelerate their pace of development while trying to obtain more and reasonable foreign aid .
historically , many floods have occurred at the huang he , china 's second - largest river .
the water conditions of the huang he , especially issues that concern the strategy for harnessing the river 's water volume , standards for floods , and balance of supply and demand of its water resources have attracted much attention .
the first water data to be determined is the volume of water .
besides , the experts have calculated the volume of water flow during the river 's biggest floods in the lower reaches seen in 1,000 years and in 100 years .
this is the basis for designs of flood prevention projects for the lower reaches of the huang he .
the experts have obtained the data for a balanced supply and demand of the huang he 's water resources and the forecast for water shortage .
of these , the amount of water consumption in henan and shandong is about 10 billion cubic meters .
the agricultural sector is the largest consumer of water , constituting about 92 percent , and the industrial sector uses about 8 percent of water .
on the basis of the water condition data obtained , the experts have begun to conduct scientific study , hear opinions from all sides , and forward new countermeasures and suggestions to harness the huang he . the relevant authorities are examining these efforts .
over the past year or so , under the cpccc 's leadership , party committees at various levels have strengthened their leadership , made arrangements meticulously , and done solid work to ensure a smooth and healthy development of the " three stresses " education .
at present , the intensive " three stresses " education for leading bodies and cadres at the level of province and ministry and the level of prefecture , city , department , and bureau has basically come to a conclusion .
overall , leading bodies and cadres have shown significant improvements in terms of ideology , political consciousness , work style , and discipline , basically meeting the cpccc 's requirements .
the overwhelming majority of comrades are politically reliable , work seriously and diligently , and constantly make progress in various aspects .
however , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .
the conspicuous problems are quite a few comrades lack a systematic study of marxist theory , lack the ability to control a complicated situation and resolve complicated contradictions , lack strict inner - party life and have not been much tempered in doing mass work .
some comrades are often prone to overestimating themselves and lack the self - discipline spirit .
a considerable portion of these comrades have problems here and there to varying degrees in party character and party style , and the problems of some comrades are even relatively serious .
therefore , it is imperative to seriously do a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level .
first of all , it is necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the central spirit and deepen the understanding of the importance and necessity of the " three stresses " education .
on this basis , it is necessary to study intensely and carefully the books on the compulsory list according to the requirements for study stipulated by the central committee .
stressing theoretical study is the foundation . it is necessary to devote sufficient time and efforts to theoretical study and arm the mind .
in - depth theoretical study will raise the level of understanding and will increase ability to find , put forward and analyze problems .
it is especially necessary to emphasize adherence to the study style of integrating theory with reality and aim at solving problems .
in carrying out " three stresses ' education in counties ( cities ) in a profound and down - to - earth manner , it is necessary to use the weapon of criticism and self - criticism to conduct positive and healthy ideological struggle .
an important reason is a lack of positive and healthy ideological struggle within the party and the failure to conduct criticism and self - criticism .
whether we can seriously and earnestly conduct criticism and self - criticism will directly affect the quality of the " three stresses " education .
in conducting criticism and self - criticism , we must not avoid the important and dwell on the trivial or avoid real issues and dwell on the abstract , and merely stay on some insignificant empty discussions .
we must resolutely overcome the anxieties of facing embarrassment and pains , and must open up our minds , address problems directly , dare to point out weakness , and seriously dissect ourselves .
in conducting criticism , we must be serious and earnest as well as enthusiastic and friendly with people .
we must communicate our thinking and enhance understanding through heart - to - heart talks .
whether in criticism or self - criticism , we must attach importance to politics , and proceed from important matters instead of getting ourselves tangled with trivial affairs .
we must seek truth from facts to reach the goal of clearly identifying the ideology as well as uniting the comrades .
in carrying out " three stresses ' education in counties ( cities ) in a profound and down - to - earth manner , we must firmly trust and rely on the masses , carry forward democracy , and earnestly adopt the mass line .
top leaders of counties ( cities ) must directly face the grass - roots . the people may have a little more opinions . however , the leaders must not be too anxious because of this and be afraid to directly conduct " three stresses " education .
our party members and cadres are to serve the people . listening adequately to the people 's opinions is the precondition and basis for offering good service to them .
we must take the " three stresses " education as a good opportunity for procuring the people 's opinions , accepting the people 's supervision , and drawing on the people 's wisdom to improve our work .
meanwhile , we must actively lead the people and enthusiastically help leading cadres of counties ( cities ) .
it has been proven in practice that " own solutions , people 's proposals , superiors ' advice , and mutual assistance " is a good way to improve our tasks .
we must believe that the majority of cadres and masses possess political awareness and are able to identify what is right and wrong .
we must correctly handle the people 's opinions and use them as a driving force to improve our work . we will then continue to improve on our ideology and work .
in carrying out " three stresses ' education in counties ( cities ) in a profound and down - to - earth manner , it is necessary to make improvement and rectification .
if possible , we must immediately rectify problems the people are concerned about so that they will continue to see the results of the " three stresses " education , thus enhancing their confidence in the " three stresses " education .
the achievements of the " three stresses " education should finally be reflected in improvement and rectification . therefore , it is necessary to take the task of deepening improvement and rectification as an important link and do it efficiently .
the members of the standing committee of the cpccc political bureau have shown us an example by engaging in mobilization activities for deepening the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) .
it is necessary to select well inspecting groups and capable group leaders so as to bring into play the role of supervision , inspection , guidance , and assurance .
we must closely integrate the " three stresses " education into the promotion of current tasks so as " not to delay but improve the education and current tasks . "
accompanied by commander tao bojun of the guangzhou military region , chi haotian arrived at the shenzhen base of the pla hong kong garrison on the morning of 19 february .
chi haotian highly praised the results achieved by the unit over the past two years and more since it stationed in hong kong .
on the morning of 20 february , chi haotian went to the zhuhai base of the pla macao garrison to visit officers and soldiers there .
he highly praised the unit for smoothly stationing in macao and carrying out its defense duties in accordance with law .
he said : the historical contributions made by the pla hong kong garrison and the pla macao garrison will shine forever in the annals of the pla 's history . during his inspection , chi haotian respectively heard briefings presented by leaders of the garrisons .
he said : in resolutely carrying out chairman jiang 's instructions and strengthening the comprehensive construction of military units , we must , first of all , be particularly qualified politically .
upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army represents our fundamental principle and our everlasting military spirit .
in terms of upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army , all officers and soldiers , particularly leading cadres at all levels , should have an extremely firm position .
chi haotian said : under the new historical condition and in the face of new situation and task , great efforts should be made to strengthen ideological and political construction and build a strong defense line for resisting corruption and degeneration .
we should also carry out education on revolutionary spirit . we should guide officers and soldiers to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard working so that they will withstand the tests of a complicated environment .
chi haotian said : the key to building qualified military units lies in building well leading groups of the party committees .
the " three stresses " requirement put forward by chairman jiang represents a fundamental requirement for strengthening the leading groups of the party committees .
leading cadres at all levels should be clean , honest , and industrious . we should strive to increase the party committees ' rally force and fighting capacity .
chi haotian particularly stressed the importance of administrating the armed forces along legal lines and being strict with them .
leading comrades from the state council li lanqing , luo gan , wu yi , and wang zhongyu attended the meeting .
zhu rongji fully affirmed the achievements scored in customs work .
comrade jiang zemin 's remark greatly jolted and produced a profound impact in the nation .
thanks to stepped up collection and management of customs duties , to strict customs duties calculation , and to in - depth checks , customs revenue went up greatly .
at the same time , reform and building of the customs sector have made major progress .
he called on cadres and staff members involving in customs work to have a full understanding of their heavy tasks and responsibilities , to strive for progress , and to do an even better job in respective areas .
first , it is necessary to continuously intensify anti - smuggling efforts , always keep up the pressure on smugglers , not to let up the effort , guard against smuggling , deal a heavy blow to smuggling , and never to allow the relapse of smuggling activities .
customs departments are urged to coordinate closely with other departments , to comprehensively manage the anti - smuggling drive , to thoroughly smash the " smuggling chain " and the " smuggling net . "
second , it is necessary to manage tax collection according to law , strictly supervise and manage tax collection , ensure collection of taxes that should be collected , and ensure fulfilling tax collection tasks .
third , reform needs to be deepened and modernization of customs system should be enhanced .
reform of customs clearance should be a starting point for the comprehensive promotion of various reforms .
there is a need to reform management system and methods of customs daily operations and to enhance customs departments ' law enforcement capabilities .
zhu rongji stressed the need to persist in strict management of the customs work and to earnestly enhance the building of the customs contingent .
he said the ranks of customs departments are generally good , have strong combat strength and are reliable .
problems as exposed in the ranks of customs departments need to be correctly recognized .
zhu rongji called on customs departments to carry out in - depth clean and honest government building and to engage in struggle against corruption .
he demanded the earnest strengthening of management and supervision over leading cadres , that all levels of leading cadres exercise strict self - discipline , honestly perform official duties , and take the lead in resisting negative and corrupt phenomena .
corruption cases must be thoroughly investigated and corrupt elements should be severely punished according to law .
unhealthy tendencies at various trades and professions need to be rectified in a down - to - earth manner . all customs personnel must be absolutely fair in enforcing the law .
all customs departments must enhance and improve internal management and concentrate efforts on doing well in management .
it is necessary to comprehensively raise the political and ideological qualities of customs personnel , to ensure their purity and combat strength , and to genuinely erect a great wall that is impregnable and indestructible .
responsible persons of relevant departments from the state council attended the forum .
located in southwestern guangdong province , gaozhou is a county - level city ( shi ) under the jurisdiction of maoming city of guangdong province .
then he went to the gaozhou 200,000 - mu litchi growing belt to inspect the agricultural development situation and also visited some peasant households .
on the morning of 20 february , jiang zemin heard reports by the gaozhou city party committee and government on party building and on preparations for conducting the " three stresses " education .
on the same afternoon , the gaozhou city party committee held the " three stresses " education meeting of leading cadres . over 600 people , including town - level party and government leading cadres in gaozhou , attended the meeting .
the " three stresses " education is aimed at pushing the party building forward and further making ideological , political , and organizational preparations for the party to advance forward in the new century .
historical experiences proved that the party building passes through the entire course which the party leads the people to fight ceaselessly ; it also provides powerful guarantees for the realization of the fighting goal of the party .
through this education , county ( city ) leading bodies and leading cadres should upgrade their awareness of " stressing study , political consciousness , and healthy trends " and be sure to noticeably improve their thinking , political integrity , work styles , and sense of discipline .
the party committees at various levels should pay attention to linking the " three stresses " education with the promotion of reform , development , and stability in the current stage .
meanwhile , standing in the forefront of the education and with the heavy task of reform , opening up , and construction , county ( city ) leaders should firmly take economic construction as a center and carefully arrange and realistically and firmly achieve the work in all areas .
so we should fully understand our historical missions , meet new requirements and tests , and strive to make self - improvement .
only when counties ( cities ) achieve their work will there be a firm foundation of the masses and a firm social foundation for the long - term order and stability of the party and the state .
with heavy responsibility , county ( city ) leading cadres should unswervingly and conscientiously study marxism - leninism - mao zedong thought and deng xiaoping theory .
jiang zemin pointed out that unswervingly implementing the party 's line , policies , and principles to the letter and resolutely carrying out the party 's line , policies , and principles despite repeated setbacks are basic political demands on all leading cadres .
there are over 2,000 counties ( cities ) in china . each county has its own actual conditions . so , we cannot ask all of them to follow the same pattern in implementing the central policies and principles and carrying out the work in all areas .
at present , the agricultural sector has entered a new stage of development , the agricultural sector and town and township enterprises are under restructuring , and the task for increasing the peasants ' incomes is very heavy .
meanwhile , state - owned enterprises are at the crucial stage of reform and development and confronted with heavy tasks of restructuring , asset realignment , technological innovation , and industrial upgrading .
the more arduous the tasks are , the more crucial the time is for leading cadres to test and enhance their wisdom , character , and morale .
the broad masses of county ( city ) leading cadres , especially young cadres , should have the daring to temper and test themselves and enhance their ability in the course of working for the masses .
jiang zemin emphasized that the transformation of the objective world and the subjective world is constantly two important tasks ahead of each and every party member and each and every party leading cadre .
the key to transforming the subjective world hinges on cultivating revolutionary character , improving mental outlook , firmly fostering accurate world outlook and accurate outlook on life and value , and firming up the belief in unswervingly fighting for the undertaking of the party and the people .
the leading cadres at various levels , including county ( city ) leading cadres , should persist in telling truth , work and behave honestly , and insist on self - respect , self - examination , self - vigilance , and self - motivation .
communist party members should further consciously strengthen their ideological accomplishment and the transformation of their own subjective world .
each and every leading cadre should think once again why he participates in revolutionary , what he should do at his leading position , and what he should leave for the later generation ?
as long as we accurately clarify these questions , then we will be able to behave justly .
communist party members build the party for the interests of the people and wholeheartedly fight for the interests of the nation and the state .
chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan and his iranian counterpart kharrazi held talks in tehran on 20 february .
foreign minister kharrazi extended a welcome to the visit to iran by foreign minister tang and his party .
he said : iranian - chinese relations have solid historical origins and the two countries have made important contributions to mankind 's civilization ; therefore today we should continue to strengthen cooperation .
iran is of the view that no country should impose its own culture and civilization on other countries .
only by carrying out exchange and dialogue between all kinds of civilizations can a better world be created .
therefore , president khatami proposed dialogue between civilizations , and the international community has positively responded to his proposal .
foreign minister tang thanked foreign minister kharrazi for his invitation and meticulous arrangements for the visit .
he said : my visit is to further enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between china and iran and to boost development of bilateral friendly cooperation in all fields .
the " silk road " of the past brought closely together the chinese and iranian civilizations , the two great civilizations of the east .
the chinese government applauds and positively regards president khatami 's proposal on dialogue between civilizations .
both china and iran are developing countries of asia and they hold identical or similar views on many important international and regional issues .
during the talks , the two sides also exchanged in - depth views on stepping up all - round cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and other fields between the two countries , and reached consensus on many issues .
foreign minister tang particularly gave a briefing on china 's economic development strategy on developing the western region of the country .
iran expressed its willingness to encourage iranian enterprises to actively take part in developing the western region of china .
the two sides also unanimously pointed out that stepping up economic cooperation between china and iran not only will benefit the people of the two countries , but also will contribute to stability and development in this region as well as in all of asia .
it is reported that this southern tour of jiang zemin may be connected with the elevation of shenzhen to a municipality directly under the central government .
in addition , since the march national people 's congress [ npc ] session is imminent , the attention of outsiders has also been aroused by whether this southern trip has anything to do with transferring guangdong provincial cpc committee secretary li changchun .
our reporter yesterday sent a telegram to the propaganda department of the shenzhen city cpc committee to inquire whether jiang zemin 's southern tour is connected with the elevation of shenzhen to a municipality directly under the central government .
the official was unwilling to release specific details , but just said that the matter has been discussed for a long time , and people will know from reading the press reports when the time comes .
according to reports , the time is now near for clinching the elevation of shenzhen to the fifth municipality directly under the central government ; this could happen this year or next , at the earliest .
according to reports , on this southern tour jiang zemin may very well console guangdong to help them understand the central authorities ' intentions and agree to shenzhen 's elevation .
if shenzhen is elevated to this status , its administrative setup will be directly subordinate to the state council leadership , and guangdong 's economic strength will be affected to a greater or lesser extent on account of shenzhen 's " independence . "
according to information , jiang zemin arrived to inspect work in guangdong the day before yesterday .
people concerned have stated that jiang zemin has always attached very great importance to work in guangdong ; when touring guangdong in 1993 , he demanded that guangdong " create new strong points and climb one story higher . "
this demand subsequently became the goal in all work in guangdong .
according to information , during his stay in guangdong , jiang zemin will inspect the army , navy , and air force units stationed in the province .
according to sources , the cpc is now launching the " three stresses " ( study , politics , and healthy atmosphere ) at all levels .
jiang zemin 's southern tour is connected with his designation of guangdong as a guidance point for the " three stresses . "
it is his strategic consideration to designate guangdong as the point for specifically guiding the " three stresses . "
outsiders had previously favored li changchun for transfer to the central authorities sooner or later .
current rumors have it that li changchun may become a vice premier at the npc next month to share responsibility for the work of vice premier wen jiabao , who is reported to be in charge of developing western china .
li changchun was suddenly transferred to the south before the opening of the 1998 npc , and people are watching to see if he will suddenly be transferred north at next month 's npc .
it is reported that this is the biggest party rectification movement since the cultural revolution , involving several million party cadres from the central authorities down to the grass roots .
according to information , the cpc central committee has decided that the several million party cadres through the country must take part in study classes to examine themselves , and also accept assessment by their subordinate cadres ; everyone has to pass the test .
beginning yesterday afternoon , workers of the shenzhen railway station were on the platform sweeping the building clean , and maintenance men were repairing the wall around the station ; the stored red carpet had also been moved onto the platform .
accompanying jiang zemin in his inspection of guangdong are central organization department director zeng qinghong and central military commission member wang ruilin ; defense minister chi haotian is currently visiting shenzhen and zhuhai to inspect the liberation army units stationed in hong kong and macao .
it is reported that an air force division from the jinan military region participated in the exercise , which was conducted after the new year with a view to mustering the fighters of a whole division to engage in long - distance sea - crossing surprise - attack operations .
those who are lucky enough to be enrolled will become pilots holding double bachelor 's degrees in the pla .
after graduation , they will be the first to be assigned to key units of the air force .
an official of a department for work toward taiwan pointed out that adjustments of the taiwan policy on a " technical level " show that the mainland 's basic policy toward taiwan will not change and need not be changed .
the mainland 's basic taiwan policy is : pursuing peaceful reunification and " one country , two systems " under the premise of one china , yet without giving up the use of force .
the mainland side maintained that this basic policy has already been " conceptually approved " by some people in taiwan and " approved in reality " by some other people in taiwan .
second , lee teng - hui 's " two - state theory " further strengthened cpc leaders ' earnest hope that " an early reunification is better than a late one . "
third , the fact that the united states keeps interfering in the taiwan issue has complicated sino - us relations .
the " eight - point proposal " primarily calls for the realization of cross - strait political negotiations .
after taiwan 's new leaders take power , the premise for resuming cross - strait political dialogue is that the new taiwan leaders must be pragmatic , that is , must not pursue taiwan independence .
preparations must be made for handling different outcomes .
since the longer the reunification issue drags on , the more troublesome the issue will become , resolving the taiwan issue at an early date has become the consensus of cpc leaders .
in a speech made at a spring festival mass greeting gathering held by the cpc central committee and the state council on 4 february , premier zhu rongji made special reference to the taiwan issue and indicated that the taiwan issue must be resolved at an early date .
therefore , if the taiwan authorities act willfully and arbitrarily and delay reunification , the cpc will have no choice but to unilaterally announce a timetable for reunification .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - learned by our reporter from the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation , the import - export operations right to china 's enterprises is being gradually transitioned from the examination and approval system to the registration system .
thus far , all the manufacturing enterprises and the scientific research institutes that meet the criterion have obtained the import - export operations right after registering with the authorities concerned in accordance with the relevant regulations .
as early as in 1996 , the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation began implementing the registration system on a trial basis among the manufacturing enterprises in the five economic special zones .
at the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 , this ministry instituted the system of putting on record the registration for gaining the import - export operations right among the country 's key state enterprises , large industrial enterprises , and their production - oriented member enterprises .
at the end of 1999 , this ministry issued documents on two occasions on implementing the registration system on import - export operations right among the state - owned and collectively owned scientific research institutes , the high - technology enterprises , and the manufacturing enterprises across the country .
currently , the production enterprises and the scientific research institutes with the right to operate import and export can be found all over the country and in all the national economic spheres .
this move has enabled numerous manufacturing enterprises and scientific research institutes to directly participate in the international competition , thus having helped expand foreign trade and export .
reportedly , 340,000 foreign - invested enterprises that were approved to establish across the country have been automatically enjoying the import - export operations right since their inauguration .
for the time being , the commercial enterprises and the private enterprises in the circulation sphere are still required to get examination and approval for engaging in import and export .
however , such a fair , reasonable , and legitimate regulation was obstructed by a legislative council sub - committee responsible for discussing and examining it and failed to pass through .
as for this , the sar government has reiterated that it will not give up its stand and will submit a new draft regulation to the legislative council for deliberation and examination later on .
whether it is conformable to the law and legal or tantamount to a privilege and " violating the ' basic law ' " for the hong kong - based central organs to enjoy immunity is a major question which must be clarified .
first , it should be pointed out that the issue of whether or not the hong kong - based central organs should enjoy immunity is not just an issue on making things faster and more convenient . rather , it is an issue concerning the principle of sovereignty .
this principle has applied to almost all common law jurisdictions , such as britain , new zealand , australia , and so on . "
the fact is : should they refrain from exercising or inheriting such immunity , the hong kong - based central organs would violate the tradition of legal precedents in a common law jurisdiction and run counter to the basic law .
though the garrison vehicles had a few small accidents , those accidents were properly settled and the garrison has never asked for special treatment or " bullied others with the backing of power . "
in the view of qian yi , academician at the chinese academy of engineering and professor at qinghua university , the beijing water crisis has become so serious that it is necessary to consider the issue of moving the capital to another place .
has the grim " water crisis " in beijing reached such a point ?
a week ago , the national bureau of statistics announced that beijing ranks first in china in terms of the general social development index .
how should we look at such a great disparity ?
as far as i am concerned , i attach more importance to the water shortage than the index .
beijing 's annual average volume of utilizable water resources is about 4.1 billion cubic meters . judging from the existing facilities and management level , this does not come up to the requirements for turning beijing into an international metropolis and a city with first - rate environmental quality .
during beijing 's water crisis in the 1970s , mass exploitation of underground water for agricultural use resulted in the development of a large funnel - shaped area , with grounds in the eastern suburbs subsiding .
even if the project to " divert water from the south to the north " is completed in 2010 , it can only provide 1.2 billion cubic meters of water . and the cost is so high that users can hardly afford it .
the river courses at the lower reaches are mostly filled with super - category 5 water substances , where basically no organisms can survive .
due to the threat of pollution , the beijing guanting reservoir stopped supplying drinking water in 1997 .
the " general report on planning for the sustainable use of water resources in the capital in the early 21st century " has named guanting reservoir as a reserve water resource in the event of an emergency .
however , it also stresses the need to speed up silt disposal and polluted water treatment .
last summer and during the spring festival this year , i went twice to hebei , which is the upper reaches of guanting reservoir .
for this reason , moving the capital to another place is not alarmist talk .
however , where should the chinese capital be moved ?
we may as well look at a group of statistical figures : of the more than 600 organically assigned cities , nearly 400 cities are short of water , including more than 130 cities with serious shortages of water .
china 's cities lack 6 billion cubic meters of water annually , with a daily shortage of more than 16 million cubic meters of water .
at present , the surface water that has become undrinkable due to pollution accounts for 40 percent of monitored waters ; 50 percent of underground waters are polluted ; and 64 percent of people drink water from unfit water resources .
nearly one half of the river segment is polluted , and one tenth of the rivers have been seriously polluted for a long time so that the water has lost its use - value .
according to an expert 's estimate , the peak of china 's water shortage will emerge in 2010 and 2020 .
at that time , except for tears , where can they find the source of life ? perhaps , the crisis awareness that has come into being and the actions taken now will be able to save beijing and china .
get into action at once !
president jiang zemin , who is currently on an inspection tour of guangdong , yesterday attended a " three stresses " meeting in gaozhou , in western guangdong .
it was reported that the central security bureau and the guangdong public security department , which were responsible for security during jiang zemin 's tour , were very nervous , and all security personnel were not allowed to make contacts with the outside .
those accompanying jiang zemin during his tour of western guangdong included li changchun , secretary of the guangdong provincial cpc committee , guangdong governor lu ruihua , and huang liman , deputy secretary of the guangdong provincial cpc committee .
no one from the central military commission was with jiang zemin during his current inspection tour of southern china .
however , liu shutian , political commissar of the guangzhou military region , was with jiang zemin where he went .
the sources said jiang zemin may inspect the 42 d army in huiyang .
another source said jiang zemin planned to visit shenzhen . but , yesterday shenzhen was not seen to have beefed up security ; no one knows if the plan has been changed because the itinerary was exposed .
the passing of the taiwan security enhancement act ( hereinafter referred to as tsea ) by the us house of representatives on 1 january [ as published ] this year has led to china 's solemn representation and caused tension in sino - us relations once again .
actually , an informed source in beijing has revealed that what liu xiaoming has said is exactly what was in the minds of china 's top leaders .
the informed source pointed out : once the united states enacts the tsea into law , beijing will react politically , diplomatically , and militarily in substance .
liu xiaoming has clearly indicated that the reaction will not stop at the level of recalling chinese ambassador . what exactly will china react to it , then ?
by that time , it would not be surprising at all to see large - scale nationwide anti - us demonstrations .
wu jichuan discussed the current major tasks in an interview with our news agency . he said : strengthening overall planning and formulating development strategies is an important duty of government departments .
- - efforts should be made to strengthen technological innovation , accelerate structural readjustment , and foster a number of enterprise groups and key product r & d bases with international competitiveness in key areas like microelectronics , software , computer and telecommunications .
he believed that as a first - level government department , his ministry has the duty to provide a strong guarantee for the healthy development of the industry , and strengthening the building of the legal system and promoting administration by law forms an important part of this duty .
to meet the needs of its accession to the wto , china will be concentrating on the drafting of the " regulations on foreign - invested telecommunications services , " " regulations on computer network and information safety " and other administrative laws and regulations .
wu jichuan said that efforts must be made to gradually develop business competition of different forms and at different levels in the sphere of telecommunications and establish a fair and effective framework of market competition through macro - control and the monitoring of market operations .
he disclosed that china was in the process of speeding up the building of a national internet switching center . the beijing internet center will be completed in the first quarter of this year and plans for the building of other regional internet centers are under way .
he said : china 's entry into the wto is an opportunity as well as a challenge for the information industry .
as long as it has strong confidence and can positively and steadily carry out reform , china 's information industry will definitely be able to set sail and forge ahead .
beijing , 21 february ( xinhua ) - - in may last year , the cpc central committee and the state council issued a circular , imposing a strict prohibition on building facilities commemorating late leading comrades .
the center , the circular pointed out , has always emphasized using the glorious achievements and revolutionary conduct of revolutionaries of the older generation to educate cadres and ordinary people at large .
over the past years , center - approved facilities commemorating revolutionaries of the older generation have played an important role in educating cadres and ordinary people at large , especially young people , on revolutionary traditions and patriotism .
however , these central regulations still have not been satisfactorily implemented in some localities , and the phenomenon of unauthorized building of facilities commemorating late leading comrades has been becoming ever more serious in a few localities .
our party is a party which serves the people whole - heartedly , and the nature and purpose of the party have determined that the party must proceed on the basis of promoting the people 's interest and aim to promote the people 's interest .
late leading comrades ' purpose of joining the revolution was to promote the people 's interest , instead leaving behind commemorating establishments showing their contributions after their death .
the unauthorized building of facilities commemorating late leading comrades is in violation of the original purpose of late leading comrades ' joining of the revolution and represents a shame in the face of the countless revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for china 's revolution and construction .
deng xiaoping 's exemplary conduct of making immortal contributions to the party and the nation and simplifying his funeral built an eternal monument in the hearts of the masses of the people and set a glorious example for the entire party and the entire country .
in the two years and more since comrade deng xiaoping 's death , some localities have proposed to build facilities commemorating comrade deng xiaoping . but , members of comrade deng xiaoping 's family proposed to the center many times that no facilities commemorating comrade deng xiaoping be built .
respecting the wishes of comrade deng xiaoping and his family , the center has so far built no facility commemorating comrade deng xiaoping .
in the future , the building of necessary facilities commemorating late leading comrades will be governed by the cpc central committee 's and the state council 's unified overall planning and arrangements ; no locality or department shall make any application or report on this matter to the center .
late leading comrades ' former residences and places of work should be used normally and shall not be turned into commemorative sites without authorization .
late leading comrades ' ashes should be appropriately placed in accordance wit the relevant rules .
late leading comrades ' ashes which are in the babaoshan revolutionary cemetery of beijing or revolutionary cemeteries of other cities should , as a general rule , not be moved to other places for burial or placement purposes .
with regard to approved requests made by late leading comrades ' families to move the ashes to other places for burial or placement purposes , it is necessary to finish all such moving at one time .
cpc committees , governments , and relevant departments at all levels should uphold principles , persist in acting in accordance with the rules , and never give any unauthorized approval for or carry out any unauthorized construction of any commemorative facility because of personal relationships .
late leading comrades ' families and former staffs may make their requests known to the relevant organizations , but should never ask land or money from localities where the relevant late leading comrades worked during their lifetimes , by exploiting the late leading comrades ' previous influence and prestige .
if some members of late leading comrades ' families or staffs reject the advice , pressure the localities , and obstinately demand the establishment of facilities commemorating the late leading comrades , such persons ' work units should seriously handle the cases .
no unit or individual shall gather funds , impose levies , collect contributions , or solicit sponsorship in the name of building or expanding commemorative facilities . 6 .
commemorative facilities in scenic and famous areas or historical and cultural preservation zones which , in violation of planning requirements , damage the scenes shall be dismantled immediately .
the finished projects which can be changed shall be changed into other social , economic , cultural , or welfare facilities .
the center will , at an appropriate time , send examination groups to urge and examine the situation of implementation of the spirit of the circular .
the late leading comrades discussed in this paper refer to comrades who held leadership positions of the provincial - ministerial level before their death , the circular pointed out .
in regard to the building of facilities commemorating other late leading comrades , the spirit of this circular should be followed where appropriate .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - today , the state council taiwan affairs office and state council information office issued a white paper entitled " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue . "
this white paper is comprised of five sections as well as a preface and concluding remarks .
the " preface " points out that resolving the taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of china is in the fundamental interests of the chinese nation .
over the last 50 years , in order to attain this objective the chinese government has been carrying out unremitting struggles .
the chinese government has been consistent from beginning to end in upholding the one - china principle and resolutely opposing any attempts to separate taiwan from china .
the struggle between the chinese government and those splittist forces led by li teng - hui is mainly manifest on the issue of upholding one - china principle or creating " two chinas " and " one china , one taiwan . "
therefore , it is necessary to further explain the standpoints and policies of the chinese government about upholding one - china principle to the international community .
all the facts and laws about taiwan prove that taiwan is an inseparable part of the chinese territory .
on the day of its establishment , the central people 's government of the people 's republic of china proclaimed to governments of all countries : " this government is the only legitimate government representing all the people in the people 's republic of china .
this government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with governments of any foreign countries on the basis of equality , mutual benefit , and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
the principle of new china for establishing diplomatic relations with foreign countries is that foreign countries must recognize the government of the people 's republic of china to be the only legitimate government representing whole china and sever or not establish diplomatic relations with taiwan authorities .
the chinese government maintains and upholds that there is only one china in the world , taiwan is part of china , and the government of the people 's republic of china is the only legitimate government representing whole china .
it is exactly in the developments of normal diplomatic relations between china and foreign countries and the struggles for safeguarding china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that this one - china principle was produced .
the above - mentioned propositions constitute the basic connotation of this one - china principle with safeguarding china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity as its core .
the just stand and reasonable proposition of the chinese government about upholding one - china principle have won the understanding and support of more and more countries and international organizations and this one - china principle has gradually generally accepted by the international community .
at present , there are 161 countries which have established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic of china and all recognized the one - china principle and agreed to handle its relations with taiwan within the one - china framework .
this basic principle and relevant policies have fulfilled the basic standpoint and spirit of upholding one - china principle and fully respected the wishes of taiwan compatriots for being masters of their own destiny and running taiwan themselves .
taiwan issue is left over by civil wars in china .
so far , the cross - strait enmity has not yet formally ended .
in order to safeguard china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize cross - strait reunification , the chinese government have the rights to adopt any necessary means .
adopting the pattern of peace is favorable to the common social development on both sides of the taiwan strait and the harmony and unity of compatriots on both sides and should be the best pattern .
the announcement of the chinese government in 1979 about implementing the guiding principle of peaceful reunification was based on one precondition : namely the taiwan authorities at that time upheld that there was only one china in the world and taiwan was part of china .
while adopting the guiding principle of peaceful reunification , the chinese government always indicates that using whatever patterns to resolve taiwan issue is the internal affairs of china and undertakes no obligation to renounce use of force .
undertaking no obligation to renounce use of force is absolutely not directed against taiwan compatriots but those foreign forces attempting to create " taiwan independence " and interfering with the reunification of china .
adopting the pattern of force will be the last option which have to be made .
if this one - china principle is not recognized but attempts are made to separate taiwan from the chinese territory , this precondition and basis for peaceful reunification does not exist anymore .
otherwise , it has damaged the external conditions for the chinese government to strive for peaceful reunification .
as far as the countries in the asian pacific region and other regions in the world are concerned , the situation in the taiwan strait is closely related to the stability in the asian pacific region .
in order to strive for peaceful reunification , the chinese government has repeatedly appealed for conducting cross - strait negotiation on equal footing and on the basis of one - china principle .
the chinese government hopes that on the basis of one - china principle , the two sides can hold consultations on equal footing to jointly discuss issues of reunification .
in order to strive for peaceful reunification , the chinese government has adopted a series of active policies and measures to comprehensively push forward the development of cross - strait relations .
and in october 1998 , leaders of these organizations met in shanghai and started cross - strait political dialogues .
these discussions and talks were conducted on equal footing .
it is proved in practice that on the basis of one - china principle it is entirely possible to find out an appropriate pattern for holding cross - strait talks on equal footing .
under the guidance of li teng - hui , the taiwan authorities have adopted a series of practical splittist steps .
since 1999 , li teng - hui 's splittist activities have further developed .
in his book of " taiwan propositions " published in may , he advocated dividing china into seven regions each enjoying " full autonomous rights . "
li teng - hui has become the chief representative of taiwan splittist forces , the destroyer of stability in the taiwan strait , the obstacle to the development of sino - us relations , and the trouble - maker for the peace and stability in the asian pacific region .
against all kinds of these splittist activities by taiwan splittist forces represented by li teng - hui , the chinese government and people have always maintained sharp vigilance and waged resolute struggles .
this struggle has demonstrated the firm resolution and capability of the chinese government and people in safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity and produced important and far - reaching influences .
taiwan compatriots have also further understood the serious harmfulness of " taiwan independence . "
internationally , these splittist activities conducted by li teng - hui were also met with severe hits .
some of the " taiwan independence " forces have been forced to give up some of their extreme splittist propositions .
after li teng - hui put forth the " state - to - state theory , " the chinese government and people waged more resolute struggles .
this struggle has become so powerful and dynamic in a way that the chinese people inside and outside china have universally condemned this " state - to - state theory . "
most countries in the world have reiterated upholding the one - china policy .
and the us government also reaffirmed upholding one - china policy and its promise of giving " three no supports " to taiwan .
and the taiwan authorities have also been forced to express not to revise its so - called " constitution " and " laws " in accordance with the " state - to - state theory . "
in the fourth section entitled " several issues involving one - china principle in cross - strait relations , " the white paper points out : china 's territory and sovereignty are not separated and the two sides across the taiwan strait are not two countries .
firstly , state sovereignty cannot be separated and territory is space for state to exercise sovereignty .
on the territory of a single country , there can be only one central government exercising sovereignty on behalf of that state .
although the two sides of the taiwan strait have not yet been reunified , the status of taiwan being part of chinese territory has never been changed . therefore , china 's sovereignty in taiwan has never been changed .
secondly , the international community recognizes that there is only one china , taiwan is part of china , and the government of the people 's republic of china is the only legitimate government in china .
thirdly , the fact that the taiwan issue fails to be resolved for a long time is mainly a result of the obstructions by foreign forces and taiwan splittist forces .
but the fact that the two sides of the taiwan strait are not reunified and the long - term existence of this kind of abnormal status cannot give taiwan any status and rights by way of international laws nor change the legal status of taiwan being part of china .
it is necessary to resolutely oppose applying the pattern of referendum to change the status of taiwan being part of china .
first of all , this legal status of taiwan being part of the chinese territory has already been affirmed by both domestic laws and international laws and the precondition for applying the pattern of referendum to decide whether self - determination should be practiced does not exist .
secondly , " sovereignty belongs to the people " means that sovereignty belongs to all the people in a country but not just certain people or the people in a certain region .
the sovereignty of taiwan belongs to the people of whole china which includes taiwan compatriots but not a part of people in taiwan .
thirdly , as taiwan had never become a country in history and after 1945 taiwan was neither a colony nor under occupation of any foreign countries , the issue of exercising the right of national self - determination does not exist .
in sum , after china recovered taiwan in 1945 , there was never such an issue of holding a referendum to change the status of taiwan being part of china .
there is only one way for taiwan in the future , namely heading towards reunification with the mainland motherland but absolutely not being separated from china .
if anyone attempts to apply the pattern of so - called referendum to separate taiwan from china , it will surely lead taiwan people into disasters .
the " module of two germanies " cannot be used in resolving taiwan issue .
the split of germany after world war ii and the temporary detachment across the taiwan strait are issues of different nature .
firstly , the reasons for their formations and the nature of their formations are different .
the issue of germany was created entirely by external factors .
and taiwan issue is left over by the chinese civil wars and an internal issue .
secondly , the status 's of these two in terms of international law are different .
the split of germany were stipulated by a series of international treaties signed during and after world war ii .
and taiwan issue was stipulated by some international treaties like " cairo declaration , " " potsdam proclamation , " and so on that japan must return taiwan which it stole from china back to china .
thirdly , the existent conditions for these two were different .
against the background of confrontation between the united states and the soviet union , the two germanies which had respectively foreign troops stationed in their territories were forced to recognize each other and coexisted in the international community .
therefore , the germany issue and taiwan issue cannot be placed in the same category , not to say indiscriminately copying the " modules of two germanies " to resolve taiwan issue .
under the principle of one china , everything can be discussed .
the chinese government maintains that the ultimate aim for holding cross - strait negotiations is to realize peaceful reunification and that holding negotiations on the basis of one - china principle is to ensure realizing the aim of negotiations .
therefore , as long as it is within the framework of one china , all issues can be discussed , including various issues with which the taiwan side is concerned .
the so - called " struggle of democracy and system " is only an excuse for obstructing the reunification of china .
realizing peaceful reunification according to the pattern of " one country , two systems " and allowing two social systems to coexist across the taiwan strait without imposing itself onto each other can best embody the wishes of compatriots living on both sides of the taiwan strait .
the fact that the two sides practice different social systems should not become an obstacle to peaceful reunification .
the essence of disagreement between the two sides across the taiwan strait on this issue is absolutely not whether it is a struggle of democracy or a struggle of social systems but a struggle between reunification and secessionism .
in examining and discussing the participation of taiwan , world trade organization should uphold the above - mentioned affirmed principle .
but the above - mentioned special arrangement does not constitute a module for other governmental international organizations and international activities to imitate .
those countries which have already established diplomatic relations with china cannot sell weapons to taiwan nor enter into any forms of military alliance .
the united states has repeatedly violated its solemn promise made in the " august 17 communique . "
at present , some people in the us congress are even cooking up a so - called " strengthening taiwan security act " and also attempting to include taiwan into the theater missile defense system .
this is a brutal interference in the internal affairs and a serious threat to the security of china , which has obstructed the process of china 's peaceful reunification and endangered the peace and stability in the asian pacific region as well as the whole world .
to this , the chinese government resolutely opposes .
the chinese government applies one - china principle in treating the external activities of taiwan .
the essence of taiwan authorities vigorously trying to push forward the so - called " pragmatic diplomacy " in the international community and expand the so - called " international existent space " is to create " two chinas " and " one china , one taiwan . "
as a matter of course , the chinese government firmly opposes to it .
upholding one - china principle does not affect taiwan compatriots in conducting non - governmental foreign exchanges nor the needs of taiwan for engaging in economic and trade and cultural activities .
the chinese government protects all the rightful and legitimate rights and interests of taiwan compatriots in foreign countries .
after the realization of cross - strait reunification , taiwan compatriots can share more dignity and honor of the people 's republic of china in the international community together with the people of all nationalities in the whole country .
we firmly believe that with the joint endeavor of all the chinese people in the whole country which include compatriots living on both sides of the taiwan strait and overseas chinese abroad , the complete reunification of china will surely be realized .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee held its 24th chairmanship meeting in the great hall of the people this morning .
the meeting decided that the 14th meeting of the ninth npc standing committee will begin on 28 february .
chairman li peng chaired the meeting .
the chairmanship meeting also heard a report made by the npc standing committee on its 2000 plan for reviewing draft laws ; and discussed the draft work report of the npc standing committee .
present at the meeting were vice chairmen tian jiyun , jiang chunyun , zou jiahua , wang guangying , buhe , tomur dawamat , wu jieping , peng peiyun , hu luli , cao zhi , ding shisun , cheng siwei , xu jialu and jiang zhenghua .
china and the united states reached a " win - win " agreement last year in negotiations on china 's accession into wto .
signs have shown that it is hopeful that china can eventually join wto this year .
government departments and various circles in the society have gradually gained a common understanding in the impact of " entry into wto " : a short - term shock will be unavoidable , but judging from a long - term point of view advantages will be greater than disadvantages .
the entry into wto will undoubtedly promote the deepening of reform of china 's state - owned enterprises and monopolized industries and improve the management and service quality so as to keep up with the general trend of china 's deepening reform and opening up wider .
besides , china will adhere to the principle of having a balance of rights and obligations and join wto as a developing country . there will be a certain transitional period for some industries and fields .
during this period , china can take advantage of the wto regulations to develop , protect , and improve ourselves by accelerating reform , improving management , optimally allocating natural resources , raising the technological level , and strengthening market participation and capacity to cope with risks .
we should also see that china 's entry into wto can bring opportunities for our textile , light industry , clothing industry , machinery and electrical appliances industry , and other labor - intensive industries to develop their international market and extricate themselves from limitations due to discriminatory policies .
besides , " entry into wto " can enable china to utilize two kinds of markets and two types of natural resources at home and abroad to promote the escalation of our industries and eliminate backward enterprises .
joining wto is a game of taking part in a global economy and so the government and enterprises must observe rules of the game and meet our commitments as a member of wto .
in the mean time , npc deputies and cppcc national committee members will pay attention to reinforcing , adjusting and improving laws and regulations involving foreign countries , using law to guarantee the implementation of stipulations of wto and reducing administrative interference .

attaching great importance to ideological and political work is a fine tradition and political strong point of our party .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - the sixth meeting of the china - india joint committee for science , technology , economy , and trade was held at the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade (mofert) this morning .
shi guangsheng , minister of foreign economic relations and trade , noted : so long as the two sides make joint efforts , it will be possible for the volume of bilateral trade to double and redouble between china and india .
today 's joint committee meeting was jointly presided over by shi guangsheng and indian minister for commerce and industry murasoli maran .
shi guangsheng said : as two neighboring big developing countries , china and india closely complement each other economically . there are all the reasons and conditions for the two sides to further develop bilateral economic relations and trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit .
sharing shi guangsheng 's view , maran said : attaching great importance to developing strong and stable relations with china , and striving to expand the bilateral trade volume , the indian government hopes to strengthen cooperation with china in fields of common interest .
he noted : india welcomes china 's early accession to the wto and believes that china 's accession will not only help strengthen the world trade system but will also expedite the development of world trade .
shi guangsheng thanked him for his support .
he said : after china joins the wto , china and india will be able to cooperate within the wto and work together to build a new order of world trade .
on the other hand , after joining the wto , china will need to learn from india 's successful experience in taking the opportunities and challenges presented by wto accession .
after joining the wto , china will learn from india 's experience of success in meeting both the opportunity and challenge offered by the wto membership .
the chinese and indian ministers made these remarks at the 6th session of the sino - indian technology , economy and trade mixed commission held here today .
shi guangsheng believes that it is possible for the bilateral trade volume between china and india to double and redouble so long as the two sides work hard together .
in 1999 , the bilateral trade volume between the two countries was nearly $ 2 billion , up 3.4 percent from 1998 .
as of the end of 1999 , the agreed amount of china 's investment in india was $ 24.6 million . konka [ shenzhen konka electronic ( group ) company , ltd . ] and haier [ the haier group ] have already set up plants in india .
shi guangsheng believes that the bilateral trade volume is far from meeting the needs of the two sides and is way below the actual capacity .
maran emphasized that the indian government attaches importance to developing firm and stable relations with china , is devoted to increasing bilateral trade volume , and hopes to promote cooperation in the fields in which both sides are interested .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - yesterday , the taiwan affairs office of the state council and the information office of the state council jointly issued the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue . "
after the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland one after the other , the settlement of the taiwan issue and the realization of the complete reunification of the motherland have entered a new stage .
the main theme idea that the one - china policy is the basis and prerequisite for the realization of peaceful reunification runs through the whole document .
since the government of our country openly announced in 1979 the principles " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " for taiwan , it has all along striven for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and efforts .
we have proposed holding cross - strait dialogue and talks on the basis of the one - china principle , not mentioning " talks between the central and local governments , " negotiating between the two sides on an equal footing and jointly discussing reunification .
with the prerequisite of the one - china principle , anything can be talked about , including the space for taiwan 's economic , cultural and social activities in the international community that are in keeping with its status , and other issues of taiwan 's concern .
if the one - china principle is undermined , the prospects for peaceful reunification will inevitably be threatened .
at present , cross - strait relations are at a crucial moment .
however , the danger of the separatist forces in taiwan attempting to separate taiwan " de jure " from the motherland still exists .
separating the motherland and seeking " taiwan independence " mean heading for war .
we believe and hope that taiwan compatriots , who choose peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait , can see through the lies and make a wise choice of their own .
we would like to , under the principle of one china , extensively exchange views with various parties , mass organizations , and personages in taiwan who advocate developing cross - strait relations , thereby actively creating conditions for conducting cross - strait dialogue and negotiations .
we hope the us government will faithfully abide by the three sino - us joint communiques and fulfill its " three noes " commitment with regard to taiwan .
we believe the international community will persistently adhere to the policy of one china and support china 's undertaking of peaceful reunification .
cherishing and safeguarding reunification has been a national consciousness deeply implanted in the chinese nation after 5,000 years of historical and cultural development .
resolving the taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the country 's and the chinese nation 's great righteous principle , great cause , and great interest of a fundamental nature .
the principle of one china must never waver and the sacred goal of reunification must be achieved .
all chinese people at home and abroad must unite , uphold the principle of one china , and strive hard to promote the accomplishment of the great cause of motherland reunification .

he hoped the race would be held continuously in an even better way .
wu bangguo expressed his appreciation for japanese friends ' efforts to promote friendship between china and japan and hoped that friendship between the two countries would pass on from generation to generation .

tehran , 20 feb ( xinhua ) - - chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan and iranian foreign minister kharrazi held talks in tehran on 20 february .
foreign minister kharrazi extended a welcome to the visit to iran by foreign minister tang and his party .
he said : iranian - chinese relations have solid historical origins and the two countries have made important contributions to mankind 's civilization . today we should continue to strengthen cooperation .
iran is of the view that no country should impose its own culture and civilization on other countries .
only by carrying out exchange and dialogue between all kinds of civilizations can a better world be created .
therefore , president khatami proposed dialogue between civilizations , and the international community has positively responded to his proposal .
foreign minister tang thanked foreign minister kharrazi for his invitation and meticulous arrangements for the visit .
he said : my visit is to further enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between china and iran and to boost development of bilateral friendly cooperation in all fields .
the " silk road " of the past brought closely together the chinese and iranian civilizations , the two great civilizations of the east .
the chinese government applauds and positively regards president khatami 's proposal on dialogue between civilizations .
both china and iran are developing countries of asia and they hold identical or similar views on many important international and regional issues .
during the talks , the two sides also exchanged in - depth views on stepping up all - round cooperation in the political , economic , trade , cultural , and other fields between the two countries , and reached consensus on many issues .
foreign minister tang particularly gave a briefing on china 's economic development strategy on developing the western region of the country .
iran expressed its willingness to encourage iranian enterprises to actively take part in developing the western region of china .
the two sides also unanimously pointed out that stepping up economic cooperation between china and iran not only will benefit the people of the two countries , but also will contribute to stability and development in this region as well as in all of asia .
since the early 1990s , lee teng - hui gradually has deviated from the one - china principle , advocating all sorts of separatist arguments and conniving at and providing support for the " taiwan independence " separatist forces .
in ideology and culture , the taiwan authorities have endeavored to obliterate the chinese awareness of taiwan compatriots , especially the younger generation , and their identification with the motherland .
in response to the perverse acts of taiwan 's separatist forces represented by lee teng - hui , the chinese government and people have always maintained sharp vigilance and fought resolutely against them .
there is only one prospect for taiwan , that is , moving toward reunification with the chinese mainland instead of moving toward separation .
the white paper is also firmly opposed to the erroneous us practice of wantonly interfering in china 's internal affairs and threatening china 's security , such as selling arms to taiwan and cooking up the " taiwan security enhancement act . "
the principle of one china is the foundation of and precondition for achieving peaceful reunification .
to strive for peaceful reunification , the chinese government has , for a long time , adopted a series of active policies and measures in order to comprehensively advance the development of cross - strait relations .
from 1978 , when the separation between the two sides of the strait ended , to the end of 1999 , cross - strait personnel exchanges , economic cooperation , and trade advanced by leaps and bounds .
following the " wang - koo meeting " in 1993 , the shanghai meeting between the leaders of the association for relations across the taiwan strait and the straits exchange foundation in 1998 opened up a political dialogue between the two shores .
practice has proven that on the basis of the one - china principle , it is entirely possible to find a proper way to conduct cross - strait negotiations on an equal basis .
the white paper stresses : as the chinese government has resumed the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong and macao , the people of the whole country are eager to resolve the taiwan issue at an early date and to realize the total reunification of the motherland .
the smooth reunification of hong kong and macao with china and the successful implementation of " one country , two systems " have fully proven that the principle of " one country , two systems " has strong vitality and is wholly suitable for taiwan .
the white paper also stresses : taiwan may apply a looser form of the " one country , two systems " principle than hong kong and macao .
we hope that more taiwan compatriots will come to hong kong and macao to have a look and personally experience the rationality and feasibility of the " one country , two systems " principle .
the 5,000 - year - long history and culture of the chinese nation has profoundly implanted strong national awareness in the hearts of the chinese , namely , china must be reunified .
the principle and stand of the chinese government and people , as openly declared in the white paper , is precisely a firm expression of such national awareness . it is also an irreversible trend of history that china will realize total reunification .
a fresh round of sino - european union [ eu ] talks on china 's wto accession will be held this morning in beijing .
if the talks proceed smoothly , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will fly to beijing later in the week for the signing of an accord .
today 's talks will take place at the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation [ moftec ] .
the chinese delegation has been headed by moftec vice minister long yongtu , while its eu counterpart has been led by eu trade commissioner lamy .
the negotiations are technical - level consultations .
it is understood that the eu asking price for market opening in these areas is higher than that of the united states .
the two sides are to discuss these crucial issues in the upcoming talks .
experts here are generally optimistic about the sino - eu agreement on china 's wto accession , holding that it is very likely to be reached this week .
following its mid - november wto deal with the united states and the removal of the main obstacles , china reached bilateral agreements with canada , australia , brazil , and many other countries .
apart from the eu , china has to reach bilateral accords with 13 other countries , including argentina , columbia , venezuela , india , and malaysia .
among the remaining negotiating partners , the eu evidently will be a major obstacle .
in a meeting on 17 february with the visiting wto director - general , mike moore , chinese state council premier zhu rongji expressed the hope that there would be " breakthrough progress " in the forthcoming sino - eu talks .
yesterday morning jiang zemin arrived at shenzhen 's new hi - tech garden , a zone built for developing hi - technology , for an inspection .
according to well - informed sources in financial circles , a " major reshuffle " involving 10 senior officials is to be carried out soon .
it is beyond expectation for such sudden personnel changes to take place in the four major banks ( the bank of china , china construction bank , industrial and commercial bank of china , and china agricultural development bank ) .
this will enable the relevant central departments to investigate their economic problems .
wang xuebing , chairman of the bank of china , has cancelled his plan to come to hong kong this week . liu jinbao , general manager of the bank of china group , suddenly returned to beijing .
liu mingkang , chairman of the everbright group , will replace wang xuebing and become acting president of the bank of china .
shang fulin , vice governor of the people 's bank of china , will replace he linxiang and become president of the agricultural bank of china .
jiang jianqing , executive vice president of the industrial and commercial bank of china , will be promoted to president of the bank .
wu xiaoling , president of the shanghai branch of the people 's bank of china , will be promoted to vice governor of the central bank .
we convey our warm congratulations to honored advanced counties , advanced collectives and advanced and model workers .
local cultural infrastructures and cultural environment show obvious improvements .
the experience created by and the pioneering spirit shown by these culturally advanced examples are the motivation and spiritual pillar for the further development of our country 's cultural causes .
we must study their excellent working styles of going deep into the grassroots , keeping links with the masses , being united and cooperating with others . we must trigger the innovative spirit and working drive of the broad masses of cultural workers .
now it is at the turn of centuries and millennia . in the great era of building socialism with chinese characteristics , we have much to do in our cultural work .
the present is a critical moment for the settlement of the taiwan issue , for it faces at one time an opportunity for reunification and a challenge of separation .
professor dai wenbin , research fellow of the institute of taiwan studies under the chinese academy of social sciences , used an eight - character phrase of " preventing further delay and propelling progress " to sum up the special significance of the newly released white paper .
during the exclusive interview with these reporters , professor dai wenbin also indicated : the " three if 's " mentioned in the white paper on a non - peaceful settlement of the taiwan issue has exactly " smashed the three illusions of the taiwan authorities . "
speaking of some people in taiwan who consider the newly released white paper as " striking up the same old tune , " wang sheng pointed out that these people have failed to grasp the true essence of the white paper .
this expert indicated : there has always been a divergence of views between the two sides of the taiwan straits on the connotation of " one china . "
so long as the taiwan authorities can return to the principled stand of " one china , " we will not demand the taiwan authorities to totally agree to the explanation that the mainland motherland has given to the basic connotation of " one china . "
professor su ge further pointed out : the one - china principle is a principle that the chinese government and chinese people have long been safeguarding with resolute and firm efforts .
in 1993 when the taiwan authorities showed signs of a deviation from the " one - china " principle , the mainland motherland heightened its vigilance .
the white paper set forth three prerequisites for the use of force .
the white paper announces that if taiwan refuses , sine die , to participate in peace talks , then that is a prerequisite for the use of force , and rightly so .
on the other hand , it also serves as a signal telling the contenders running for the leadership of taiwan that defining cross - strait relations by basing them on the " two - state theory " and sabotaging the reunification of the motherland will be resolutely opposed .
people in the political circle reiterated : first , the chinese government has been consistent in upholding a positive and sincere attitude in the drive of peacefully resolving the taiwan issue .
second , the basic meaning of one china has never been changed , that is , there is only one china in the world , taiwan is a part of china , and the prc government is the sole legal government representing all of china .
third , the chinese government announced the principle of peaceful reunification only because the then - taiwan authorities also insisted that there is only one china in the world and taiwan is a part of china .
fourth , the chinese government announced the principle of peaceful reunification under the consideration of a better external environment at that time , where the united states established ties with china , signed three joint communiques , and admitted the principle of one china .
however , although the joint communiques were signed , the united states has been repeatedly violating the communiques and continuously sold advanced weapons to taiwan .
currently , in the us congress , some people are concocting the so - called " taiwan security enhancement act , " and attempting to include taiwan in the theater missile defense system .
the moves of the united states are not advantageous to china 's cause of resolving the taiwan issue in a peaceful manner .
fifth , under the principle of one china , any questions can be discussed .
taiwan 's international space compatible with its status and the political status of the taiwan authorities can all be discussed .
sixth , any attempt to separate taiwan from china through a so - called referendum would only lead the taiwan people to disaster .
the party committees and government organs at all levels should regard organizing the study of the important expositions given by the leadership core of the three generations as one of the important tasks and grasp them firmly and well .
we should realistically give priority to ideological and political work in the army 's various development fields , and persist in attaining higher standards and setting stricter demands in ideological and political work .
we should deeply summarize and absorb experiences and lessons from the struggles in the ideological and political field , study and come forward with specific measures for strengthening and improving ideological and political work and grasp them with earnest efforts .
creating brilliance in the past the division , a crack unit of the air force , is stationed on the southeastern coast .
over the past nearly 50 years since it was established , stationed at some 38 airfields one after another , it has flown some 17 types of planes .
during the war to resist us aggression and aid korea [ 1950-1953 ] and in other air defense battles aimed at defending the territorial land , the division shot down or damaged some 17 enemy planes .
moreover , it was also the first unit to undertake such a nuclear test task as flying fighter planes through the " mushroom " to take a sample .
the division has been good at fighting tough battles during wartime and bold to undertake heavy tasks in peacetime .
last october , a team sent by the division won the group championship in a large - scale training contest organized by the air force among maintenance units .
the division was also chosen by the general staff department as a first - class military training unit .
in particular , the division has fulfilled the largest number of combat exercise tasks with the best results .
in a major exercise organized by the nanjing theater in the third quarter of last year , the division 's units kept a close watch on and patrolled over the taiwan straits , thus demonstrating a strong fighting capacity of defending the country 's sovereignty and dignity .
training " new tactics " at present though the gun smoke of the gulf war has long subsided , the people longing for peace have never forgotten about it .
during more than 40 days of fighting , the air force fought for some 38 days . in some eight relatively large - scale local wars fought in the world in the 1990s , six involved or were independently completed by the air force .
over the past few years , the division has adhered to fighting capacity as a criterion and has conducted strict and difficult training with an eye on training itself into a crack unit .
especially , it has stepped up tactical and technological training on some extremely difficult topics and scored fruitful results .
by proceeding from a real war 's needs , a certain regiment of the division has reequipped scores of pilots by batches and has managed to conduct reequipment , complete reequipment , and generate fighting capacity during the same year .
in a training exercise held last november on striking air targets with missiles , all the 15 missiles the regiment fired hit the targets .
last summer , though the sky was covered with dark clouds , led by squadron leader wang , commander of " du fengrui group , " four fighter planes whizzed right into the sky on a guard and patrol mission over the southeastern coast .
ten minutes after the planes took off , it began to rain heavily .
the fighter planes continued their air patrol over the sea , braving the wind and rain , piercing the clouds , and penetrating the mist .
on their way back , as it was raining heavily , the visibility extremely low .
however , the pilots of " du fengrui group " remained exceptionally calm and confident about themselves . the group commander was the first to lower his flight altitude . after he courageously and resolutely landed his plane , other pilots followed suit with confidence .
two minutes later , all the four planes smoothly landed one after another and this attested to the pilots ' excellent flight skills and bold , vigorous , and brave fighting style .
in light of the characteristics of a night battle , it has organized training aimed at improving sudden mobility at night by increasing night flight training time and proportion .
last year , the division became one of the units that had spent most of the time on night flight in the whole air force .
in light of the needs of a war , it has conducted training on transregional rapid mobility and long - distance strikes ; tempered its pilots ' fighting will ; and trained its pilots ' fighting style .
it has studied and developed a whole set of new tactics , such as confrontation on the sea , surprise attack on the sea , preemptive attack on the enemy , hitting all targets during the first strike , and so on .
all its pilots have learned and mastered with excellent results both flexible and variable tactics and the law of defeating the enemy and winning a victory .
division commander zhang and political commissar su told us that they are fully confident of the division 's fighting capacity .
lan fu was forced to surrender to the chinese embassy on finding himself to be a stranger in a strange place after he fled to australia . he also requested that the chinese government not investigate his wife who had fled with him .
in a related development , the central authorities transferred hunan province 's yueyang city party committee secretary zhang changping to the post of executive deputy secretary of the xiamen city party committee to reinforce the leadership of xiamen city .
in early january , xiamen vice mayor lan fu , accompanied by his wife who worked in the state security bureau in xiamen city , left the country through shanghai customs and fled to australia .
before new years , lan fu and his wife applied for visas at the australian consulate in shanghai on the pretext of new years travel . after that they went to australia together , trying to evade investigation by the central investigative team .
on 30 january 1995 , president jiang zemin published his important speech entitled " continue to strive for the completion of the great reunification cause of the motherland . "
taiwan compatriots have further realized the danger caused by " taiwan independence " to their immediate interests , while the international community has also come to see the importance of sticking to their one - chinapolicy .
in the wake the crisis on the taiwan sea between 1995 and 1996 , the state leaders of china and the united states paid mutual visits to each other , and china and the united states decided to devote common efforts to building up a constructive strategic partnership .
at a meeting of the general committee of the un assembly held last year , the five permanent members of the un security council unanimously spoke , for the first time , against taiwan 's bid to " get into the united nations . "
lee teng - hui 's " two - state theory " has turned him into an unpopular " troublemaker . "
the practice of the struggle against splittism and " taiwan independence " has shown clearly that the basic principle set in president jiang 's eight - point proposal is a powerful weapon for safeguarding china 's state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the industrial and commercial circles have all the more made a greater appeal for changing the policy of " refraining from impetuosity and exercising forbearance " which is currently pursued by the taiwan authorities .
meanwhile , the trend toward a mutually complementary and mutually beneficial economic cooperation across the strait is currently undergoing further growth .
at a time when we are marking the fifth anniversary of the publication of president jiang 's eight - point proposal , taiwan is holding an election to change local leaders , and is therefore in the middle of a period featured by complicated political changes .
once the one - china principle is violated , the foundation and prerequisite of a peaceful reunification will be ruined .
all the chinese people will by no means sit idly watching all these remarks and actions which aim at splitting the motherland .
we deeply believe that a complete reunification of the motherland can surely become a reality .
in the last five years , while the separatist forces in taiwan have expanded and " taiwan independence " has become rampant , mainland china distinguishes the taiwan authorities from the taiwan people , distinguishing the separatist forces and " taiwan independence " from the taiwan people .
the sentiments among the cross - strait peoples have not changed .
and as to the more complex mentality of our taiwan compatriots that has evolved due to objective realities and historic causes , mainland china is very understanding of that .
the history of the development of cross - strait relations shows that the taiwan people are one of the most important forces for opposing separatism , fighting " taiwan independence , " and promoting the development of cross - strait relations .
we believe that the taiwan people will definitely continue to display our glorious patriotic traditions , acting in the new age to promote the development of cross - strait relations , to make their own contribution to the eventual reunification of their native country .
in his speech delivered at the cppcc 's chinese new year tea party this year , president jiang zemin again stressed : " we have attached great importance to the special characteristics of taiwan which are different from those of hong kong and macao .
in our bid to settle the taiwan issue and bring true a peaceful unification in line with the principle of " one country , two systems , " we can adopt a more flexible approach than that towards hong kong and macao . "
this has once again showed clearly the profound sincerity , as well as the highly pragmatic and highly flexible approach , of chinese leaders in using the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems " to settle the taiwan issue .
the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems " was first designed for the settlement of the taiwan issue .
the principle of " one country , two systems " is a brand - new practice which has no precedent to go by , and therefore needs to undergo constant improvements during the process of its implementation .
the taiwan issue has its own specific characteristics that are different from those of the hong kong issue .
whereas the hong kong issue was a historical issue left over by colonial aggression , the taiwan issue is an issue left over by china 's civil war and is totally an internal affair of china .
therefore , during the process of implementing the principle of " one country , two systems , " there surely exist differences between hong kong , macao , and taiwan ; and concrete policies should also give expression to the different specific characteristics of the three .
vice premier qian qichen also pointed out in beijing the other day : during the process of settling the taiwan issue , we ought to introduce more flexible policies than those designed for hong kong and macao .
president jiang zemin 's eight - point proposal has , all the more , displayed our determination and sincerity in practicing the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems . "
facts over the past 20 years have proved that the factor of the mainland motherland is a strong and positive factor in the economic exchange across the strait , and in the economic growth of hong kong and macao .
all people of insight in taiwan should make serious reflections on this issue , seize this historical opportunity , and make a wise choice .
the two sides of the taiwan strait has been separated from each other for more than half a century , yet one should understand that the happy reunion and reunification of the chinese nation is an inexorable trend of history .
on the eve of the opening of the 10th un trade development council meeting , this writer was alarmed at a report and some figures .
the report said that a us company was cloning a sheep for a billionaire , who was willing to pay $ 2.3 million .
no one has the right to interfere in the cats or dogs raised by the rich .
the question is that living conditions of the poor people , who account for 21 percent of the world 's population , are deteriorating . they even have difficulty surviving . this does accord with the basic principles of the un human rights declaration .
the bangkok declaration and program of action adopted at the meeting reflected the strong voice of the developing nations .
the bangkok declaration emphasized the necessity of establishing a fair and regular " multilateral trade system " and operating in a nondiscriminating and transparent way , which would be conducive to all the countries , the developing ones in particular .
the program of action proposed helping the developing nations .
the key to the question now is whether these calls can be put into action .
as the un trade development council has no right to draft international rules and regulations , the developing nations have urged at the meeting the world bank , the imf organization , and the wto to introduce reforms .
first , all the member nations should participate in amending the outdated , unfair , and irrational international rules and regulations , and jointly draft new international rules and regulations .
the group of latin american nations issued a statement , which said that they would refuse to sign any agreement reached by a handful of developed nations .
second , the amended or newly drafted international rules and regulations should be conducive to the economic and trade development of all countries .
several thousand representatives from more than 100 countries had attended the previous un trade development council meetings , which spent a huge amount of funds .
as to the meaning of deflation , academia differs considerably , certainly not agreeing .
understanding and grasping the deflationary trend that has appeared in china for two - plus years will directly affect the direction and intensify of our macroeconomic regulation and control policy .
as to this trend , we should neither treat it lightly or overestimate it .
so we need to do an in - depth and conscientious analysis focused on key matters in china 's current inflationary trend such as its features , causes , and control remedies .
major features the current deflationary trend that has appeared in china has the following features : 1 .
it is mild .
as to the extent of the price decline , prices declined more than 15 percent in the united states during the recession following world war i. and in the great depression of the 1930's , prices fell over 30 percent .
china 's overall prices have been falling for just a little over two years , for a drop of around 2 - 3 percent .
so in contrast to the historic deflationary periods that lasted over two and three decades , in which prices dropped some dozen and even dozens of times , this should be considered mild deflation . 2 .
it is of a certain corrective nature .
in the previous period from 1993 through 1995 , china had a high sustained inflation rate of 13.2 percent , 21.7 percent , and 14.8 percent for those years respectively , with our price level containing a considerable " bubble " component .
so this overall price decline has a rational element , playing a corrective role for the previous high inflation and price bubble . 3 .
it is accompanied not by economic recession or depression , but rather fast economic growth .
historically , while sustained overall price declines have been often accompanied by economic recession or depression , there are also cases in which they have been accompanied by sustained economic growth .
it has appeared in a sharply changed market order in china 's economic transformation .
through over two decades of reform and opening efforts , china 's overall national might is up sharply , which has fundamentally changed the past longstanding general and sharp commodity shortage , to bring a staged and structural market order of long supply .
it is in this order that china is seeing a sustained overall price decline . 5 .
it is also affected by international prices .
as s & t have developed briskly throughout the world and economic structural adjustment has accelerated , and impacted by the asian financial crisis , a certain international deflationary state has appeared .
causes since deflation and inflation are both monetary phenomena , we often stress their monetary causes , holding that inflation is caused mainly by a too large money supply , while deflation is due mostly to a too small money supply .
at present , our real economy is subject to slack demand for monetary capital due to many reasons .
so while the financial authorities would subjectively like to ease the monetary credit supply somewhat , such as finding ways to lend more , due to a lack of willingness by borrowers , they can hardly do so .
in fact , the current deflationary trend is both a monetary and economic phenomenon . meanwhile , it has both monetary and real economic causes , with the deeper ones being economic .
since china 's current deflationary trend is due to both overall supply and overall demand , we need to analyze it .
we will speak of overall demand first .
overall demand is made up of overseas demand and domestic demand .
overseas demand is export demand .
once the asian financial crisis occurred in 1997 , china 's exports were sharply affected . and while they have improved somewhat recently , they still cannot be said to be completely stable .
domestic demand includes investment demand and consumer demand .
in recent years , due to a number of causes , these two domestic demands have both been short .
and since banks have gained a higher security mentality through reform , placing more emphasis on lending quality , they are subject to a " grudging lending " tendency .
since commercial bank lending was eased somewhat , a considerable amount of credit capital has become arbitrage or hedge funds , divorced from the real industrial sector .
all of this hinders indirect bank - enterprise financing .
and since the chinese capital market is still developing , being far from mature , direct financing means are also very narrow .
all of which limits investment demand .
to keep the economy growing fast , a definitely high accumulation rate is essential .
in recent years , since economic prospects have declined due to structural reorganization , with more layoffs , the increase in individual immediate income and expected income has slowed somewhat .
the income gap is widening , particularly that between former system personnel and those who are outside of the system .
consumer demand by the high - income group is basically saturated , while the masses of low - income individuals lack purchasing power , which tends to weaken the average consumer demand of our whole society .
the imbalance in our society 's overall supply and demand is not caused by the demand shortage alone , also being caused by oversupply and hard supply .
oversupply refers to the excess industrial output capacity and product mix formed by years of blind investment and duplicate construction , as well as a staged surplus of farm products due to successive bumper harvests .
in short , as practice develops , our policy is being steadily improved , with the steps growing constantly stronger .
the past years of successfully controlling inflation and the last two years of actively curbing the deflation trend shows that the party central committee has acquired more mature skill in governing the overall economic order , having acquired richer experience in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control .
this series of macroeconomic policy steps taken by the center has effectively curbed a severe decline in our economic development rate that might have occurred , having played and continuing to play an active role in pulling economic growth , to promote a rebound in economic efficiency .
particularly since the last half of 1999 , the bright spots in china 's economic operations have increased , with the overall price decline trend also tending to be eased .
these will play a key role in further expanding domestic demand and improving supply , to effectively curb the deflationary trend .
i would note that , to control the deflation trend , by either expanding demand or improving supply , it will not do to rely solely on regulation and control through macroeconomic policy , because they [ supply and demand ] are also limited by our current system .
we need to tighten macroeconomic regulation and control , while stressing a better system and forces solution to the problems of expanding demand and improving supply .
even once the deflationary trend is eased , system or institution building will remain a continued long - term need .
as all know , the impact of economic reform in promoting economic development often needs a process to be shown .
and some reform steps , as to their short - term impact in expanding demand and improving supply , not only cannot play an influential role , rather having a temporarily restraining effect .
while such reform steps are particularly essential and imperative , in all future reform steps , we need to do all possible to put them into effect at the right time , for a well - planned reform rhythm .
the japanese economy was subject to such a state in the 1990's , which merits our attention .
the force or intensity and time of our macroeconomic expansionary policy needs to be suitably adjusted in a timely way in line with changes in supply and demand relations and price trends .
this is a key matter that we must not overlook in the course reversing the deflationary trend .
beijing , 22 feb xinhua ) - - chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (moftec) shi guangsheng and indian minister of commerce and industry murasoli maran signed a bilateral agreement on china 's entry into the world trade organization (wto) here this afternoon .
after the two sides signed the agreement , shi guangsheng said : china and india are important developing countries in the world and also great neighbors .
murasoli maran said that india fully supports and welcomes china 's entry into the wto .
the signing of the bilateral agreement has very important significance and will be of help to the further growth of bilateral economic and trade relations .
india will work in cooperation with china to promote the growth of world trade and for the interests of the developing nations around the world .
incomplete statistics showed that in the first 10 months of 1999 , the government purchase funds across the country had totaled some 7.5 billion yuan with the average saving rate standing at 13.5 percent and some 1 billion yuan saved .
it is reported that the negotiations between china and india , which are the two largest developing countries in the world , proceeded very smoothly and reached an agreement very quickly .
the state - owned enterprise (soe) reform , without doubt , will be the top economic subject at the " two sessions " this year .
great achievements were scored in the soe reform last year .
the official statistics shows that nearly 90 percent of areas in the 30 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities throughout the country have , in varying degrees , increased profits or eliminated or reduced losses .
of all industries , the most prominent is the textile industry , which has ended the loss - inflicted situation that lasted as long as six years . the economic returns of other industries have been noticeably enhanced too .
among the 6,599 large and medium industrial enterprises that suffered losses at the end of 1997 , which were either state - owned or controlled by soes , a total of 3,100 enterprises no longer suffered losses .
according to an analyst , the enhancement of soe 's ability in international competition as quickly as possible is the principal direction of the future soe reform and development .
in order to meet with and participate in international competition in a positive attitude , china will concentrate greater efforts on setting up important and crucial sectors to prop up a number of large enterprises and groups with tremendous strength to accelerate their development speed .
the fierce competition for qualified personnel , which will be triggered by china 's wto entry , has become another hot spot in reform for which people are universally concerned .
the wto specialists who are familiar with the national conditions , possess rich professional knowledge , and have a relatively high foreign language standard will become the key objects for training by the state and enterprises .
therefore , enabling the soe managers to walk out from the personnel management structure as well as setting up a qualified personnel database and entrepreneur rating system will be one of the significant moves of the soe reform in future .

china condemns all violent acts that may bring new instability to kosovo , and calls on the relevant parties to exercise restraint and prevent the tension from further escalating .
at the foreign ministry 's news briefing today , zhu bangzao said : the kosovo issue is a very complicated ethnic and religious problem rooted in a region of yugoslavia .
he said : china 's position on the kosovo issue is very clear .
beijing , 22 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao gave a fairly detailed account here today of the high - level meeting between china and the united states .
from 17 to 18 february , chinese vice foreign minister yang jiechi and visiting us deputy secretary of state strobe talbott held sino - us strategic and security consultations .
us participants in the consultations included undersecretary of defense walter b. slocombe , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joseph ralston , deputy national security adviser to the president james b. steinberg , and ambassador to china joseph prueher .
the spokesman pointed out : the issue of ballistic missile defenses was one of the central topics of the consultations .
this plan is not conducive to the global strategic balance and stability , nor is it conducive to regional peace and security . in addition to damaging the legitimate security interests of other countries , it will eventually work against the united states .
zhu bangzao said : sino - us relations are now faced with opportunities for further improvement and development ; there are also challenges .
he said that china is willing to join hands with the us side in advancing sino - us relations in the direction defined by the presidents of the two countries and toward the goal established by them .
zhu bangzao said : the chinese side emphatically pointed out that the taiwan issue has always been the most important and the most sensitive issue at the core of sino - us relations .
china hopes that the us side will strictly observe the three sino - us joint communiques and relevant commitments and properly handle the taiwan issue . this is of the utmost importance to the healthy and stable development of sino - us relations .
the us side said : the clinton administration is committed to developing us - china relations .
president clinton is determined to further advance us - china relations in the direction of a constructive strategic partnership during the remaining months of his tenure .
president clinton is firmly committed to winning support from the us congress for permanent normal trade relations with china .
talbott said that the us government opposes the taiwan security enhancement act and will prevent it from becoming law .
the us side said that it attaches great importance to and will seriously study the views and stances that the chinese side expounded during the consultations .
recently , the us - based " los angeles times " and other newspapers reported that a chinese - american bought and " secretly shipped " the infra - red camera , which is used on missile guidance systems and early warning systems , for china .
zhu bangzao solemnly pointed out : the report was groundless .
he pointed out : the imported infra - red thermal imaging system is manufactured by the us raytheon company and published openly in the " 1999-2000 james ' [ 6124 3044 ] photoelectricity systems yearbook . "
it is used for all - weather monitoring of vessels on river courses , especially for the anti - smuggling boats of the chinese customs , which is open for bidding , and it is not used for military purposes .
the spokesman said : the chinese company has provided its american counterpart with written explanations on the end - users and purposes of the device .
wang shaohong was introduced to falun gong exercises in march 1997 believing that it can help cure illnesses and terminal diseases .
feeling very furious , he tore up 20 falun gong - related books about falun gong , smashed 16 relevant tapes , burned relevant portraits and emblems , and submitted 34 books of experience sharing .
in order to further alert himself and educate other people , wang shaohong borrowed a video recorder and bought videotapes to record eight tapes of programs shown on tv about ferreting out the true cult nature of falun gong .
" the reason i recorded these programs is to always educate myself to firmly break away from falun gong .
meanwhile , i will let my relatives , friends and former practitioners watch these , and will persuade all of them to break away from the falun gong cult organization in order not to be further cheated by li hongzhi , " he said .
lan fu , former vice mayor of xiamen and one of the key figures in a big smuggling case involving 80 billion yuan , fled to australia . he recently was arrested by mainland authorities in hong kong , however .
according to well - informed sources , as lan fu led a hard life in australia , he called xiaman city cpc secretary hong yongshi , asking hong to allow him to work in the xiamen office in hong kong through a " back - door deal . "
with the intervention of the relevant mainland departments , lan fu was arrested in hong kong last week and sent to beijing for investigation .
all major suspects related to the yuanhua smuggling case have been arrested .
at that time , hong yongshi immediately accepted his request and approved his coming to hong kong .
it has been learned that upon lan 's arrival at the xiamen office , he first contacted hong yongshi . according to hong 's instructions issued during the telephone conversation , lan did not contact anyone . he directly went to a certain designated house .
when lan fu entered the house , several mainland investigators had already been " waiting for him " there . lan was arrested immediately . he was sent back to xiamen by sea the next day .
after arriving in xiamen , he again was sent to beijing by plane for investigation .
it also has been learned that on his way back to xiamen under escort , lan fu realized that he had failed to attain his hope .
this also showed that he is politically naive , because he believed that he could still bargain with the authorities .
although lan fu did not dare ask to be transferred back to work at home , he wrongly believed that hong kong was a good haven for him .
then jiang listened to an account of work given by shenzhen officials .
he said that the development of national hi - tech undertakings would be one of the priorities of china 's economic development in the new century .
beijing is now hotly probing and fiercely handling the smuggling shielding case of li jizhu , former vice minister of public security .
following the central commission for discipline inspection 's deployment of massive forces to investigate the xiamen yuanhua smuggling case , the commission now has urged guangdong to investigate and handle the smuggling case involving li jizhou .
guangdong 's efforts to investigate and handle the li jizhou case has achieved some results , and found the case involving several cities such as shenzhen , guangzhou , and qingyuan .
businessmen involved gave list of corrupt officials .
the businessman was arrested at the end of last year and admitted that responsible officials from shenzhen and guangzhou customs were involved .
reportedly , the case is widespread , and some responsible officials from respective departments of the people 's liberation army general departments are also involved .
it is said that beijing has ordered the guangdong authorities solemnly investigate and handle the case . whoever is involved will be investigated thoroughly .
we believe the release of the current white paper is of positive and important significance to the solution of the taiwan issue at an earlier date .
first , the general election for a new leader in the taiwan region will be held soon .
second , now hong kong and macao have all been smoothly returned to china and both sides of the taiwan strait will join wto .
the former has proven by reality that the reunification of china according to the principle of " one country with two systems " is totally feasible .
although the taiwan issue is different from the situation of hong kong and macao , but the difference must never be used as a pretext to reject peaceful reunification .
if taiwan , hong kong , macao and the mainland of the motherland are combined and cooperation among all regions is strengthened , we are convinced it will be beneficial to economic development in all places .
third , reform and opening up on the mainland of the motherland are being deepened and expanded .
reports from foreign news agencies note that the year 2000 will be an " economic year " for china .
china will formulate the " tenth five - year plan , " promote a plan of " great development in the western region , " and accelerate the three major reforms including the reform of state - owned enterprises .
in the meantime , the newly elected leader in taiwan will also step up efforts to promote taiwan 's economic construction .
if cross - strait relations can be improved and developed under the principle of " one china , " we are convinced that it will definitely create new opportunities for cooperation and the two sides can work together to revitalize the chinese nation .
one china is the core content of the white paper .
whether taiwan and the mainland belong to " one state " or " two states " is not a general question . instead , it is a question of principle and the cardinal issue of right and wrong .
this is an unavoidable question which must be answered by all chinese people , including compatriots in taiwan .
taiwan 's authorities said : " the republic of china has been an independent , sovereign state since 1912 . "
however , people all know that the " state " and the " government " representing the state are two different things .
this is even more absurd and ridiculous . did the kmt regime in taiwan ever govern taiwan before recovering taiwan from japan ?
did people now in taiwan paid any taxes to japan ?
since they never did , how could they take taiwan back ?
why ?
the reason is quite simple . state sovereignty can only be exercised by the government representing the country . when the old government was overthrown , naturally only the new government could replace the old government to exercise sovereign rights .
being afraid to face reality , resorting to sophistry in self - justification , distorting the truth and deceiving the people are the most miserable things done by taiwan 's ruling authorities .
meanwhile , there are plenty of such things as " taiwan first , " " giving priority to taiwan , " and " a community of life in taiwan . "
all people in taiwan are chinese . the difference is only who went there earlier and who went there later . there is no difference between taiwanese and chinese .
people on both sides are of one blood , are bound together in a common cause , and have gone through thick and thin together .
all these can only be done by adhering to and protecting the principle of one china .
therefore , whether those people can adhere to and protect the principle of on china or not divides those who truly love taiwan and those who falsely love taiwan .
it is precisely stated in the white paper released at this time that the principle of one china is the foundation stone of the chinese government 's policy toward taiwan and that only by adhering to the principle of one china , can we realize peaceful reunification .
all these have shown that we must not let down our guard toward the situation within taiwan at present .
what particularly worth noticing at present is a " joining force " by kmt and dpp . " in other words , kmt is " converting into dpp " while dpp is " converting into kmt . "
the kmt 's " two state theory " and dpp 's " taiwan independence argument " are getting closer .
the " separatist theory " advocated by them is definitely not " loving taiwan " but " bringing ruin " to taiwan . "
we can only place our hopes of taiwan 's future and the reunification of the motherland on people in taiwan who have the honorable tradition of patriotism .

beijing , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - central military commission chairman jiang zemin recently signed an order to promulgate the implementation of the " program on building headquarters of the chinese people 's liberation army . "
the promulgated " program on building headquarters " is the first law specially regulating and guiding the construction of the commanding headquarters in the history of our army .
it has inherited and incorporated the fine tradition and fresh experience of our army in building the headquarters . it is very strongly characterized by ideology , regulation , and guidance , and is the primary basis for our army 's construction of the headquarters during the new period .
the " program " goes into effect from the date of its promulgation .
guangzhou , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - zhang changli , chairman and president of huali industrial company limited in shunde city , guangdong province , colluded with a bank official to illegally gather capital amounting to 13.5 billion yuan by offering high interest rates .
recently , the shunde city people 's court in guangdong province sentenced zhang changli to 10 years in prison and ordered him to pay a fine of 200,000 yuan on charges of illegally soliciting funds from the public .
zhang changli fled the country after his case was uncovered in september 1997 .
in march 1998 , public security organs , through interpol , asked police in new zealand , cuba , tonga , thailand , and malaysia to assist in tracking down zhang changli .
with the help of the police in a southeast asian country , chinese public security organs arrested and extradited zhang changli back to china in may 1999 .
at the same time , the depositors were asked to sign a document promising not to withdraw their money before a certain prescribed period .
after finishing the paperwork , huali industrial company limited paid the depositors either the high - interest portions or all interest in advance . when their deposits reach maturity dates , depositors might go to the beijiao office to withdraw their principal or remaining interest with their passbooks .
since the case came to light , huali industrial company limited still owed depositors approximately 600 million yuan .
zhang changli 's case of illegally soliciting deposits from the public was an economic crime that severely violated the state financial administration system and disrupted the financial order , incurring enormous losses of state , collective , and personal property .
the successful investigation and trial of zhang changli 's crime fully indicates our government 's determination to severely crack down on economic crimes and safeguard the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy .

zheng yunmei , deputy director of information bureau of the general office of the npc [ national people 's congress ] standing committee , told this reporter that the website " china npc news " introduced last october has been visited by a large number of people .
during their " two sessions , " their websites were visited tens of thousands times a day .
during the " two sessions , " quite a few e - mail messages received replies from the municipal people 's congress deputies and cppcc committee members and some problems were also resolved with the help or under the supervision of the deputies and members .
a beijing citizen had complained about a restaurant downstairs , saying that it was noisy and its oil smoke had harassed the residents to a serious extent .
li disheng , vice chairman of the beijing municipal cppcc committee , immediately sent a reply , saying that the problem would be looked into and tackled .
shortly afterwards , it was learned from the departments concerned that the restaurant , which had harassed the residents , had stopped its business for rectification .
the party central committee also decided to appoint comrades chen yujie ( female ) , xie xuren , and wang chengming as deputy secretaries of its financial work committee .
the recent exchanges and reshuffles of the major leading cadres of some financial institutions were decided by the party central committee and the state council after giving prudent consideration to all factors to meet the needs of work and comply with the characteristics and reality of financial institutions .
their method will help further develop the financial work , strengthen the leading bodies of financial institutions , train and bring up leading cadres , and make leading bodies younger in average age .
in recent years , henan province has made remarkable achievements in using their own advantages and readjusting its agricultural structure .
the major grain - and cotton - producing areas should continue to fully use their advantages while making structural readjustment .
first , it is necessary to shift from the general grain variety to a good - quality , special grain variety .
this is an important aspect of the readjustment of the country 's agricultural structure , and , more importantly , it is the main direction of structural readjustment in the major grain - and cotton - producing areas .
we should make vigorous efforts to improve strains by raising their quality and to develop grain and cotton production with good quality .
second , it is necessary to shift from the simplistic grain and cotton production to the simultaneous development of a diversified economy .
while developing a diversified economy , we must effectively protect our basic farmland , continue to step up the construction of agricultural infrastructure , and preserve our agricultural - production ability .
third , it is necessary to shift from extensive to intensive farming .
while giving full play to the production scale of major grain - and cotton - producing areas , we should pay close attention to quality , cut the cost , improve the efficiency , and increase our market competitiveness .
fourth , it is necessary to develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products according to market demand and local conditions .
this will make it possible not only to increase the added value of agricultural and sideline products and peasants ' incomes but to provide a variety of high - quality agricultural products for consumers and to open an ever larger market for sustainable agricultural development .
for historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic . in the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .
wen jiabao pointed out : to accomplish the various tasks in agricultural and rural work in the new stage , it is necessary to effectively strengthen and improve the party 's leadership over rural work .
stress should be laid on doing the following work well : 1 . it is necessary to increase the guidance on structural readjustment , to dovetail production and marketing , and to assist peasants in solving problems in production .
agricultural departments at various levels should increase technical guidance , step up the popularization of new technologies , carry out various supportive measures , and regulate the supply of good - quality , special seeds . 2 .
it is necessary to effectively strengthen wheat - field management .
agricultural technicians should be organized to check up on the growth of cereal crop seedlings , the soil moisture content , and plant diseases and insects in the field and to guide peasants in spring field management . 3 .
it is necessary to ensure the supply of materials for spring plowing and sowing .
credit cooperatives should take the initiative in providing credit for spring plowing and sowing .
accompanying wen jiabao on the inspection tour were ma kai , wan baorui , han changfu , wang mingyi , and other responsible officials of relevant departments .
this is the common understanding expressed by military and non - military experts at a discussion meeting held today in beijing .
meeting participants generally felt that the release of the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " is very essential and timely .
the meeting participants pointed out that following the successive return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the task for settling the taiwan issue and achieving complete reunification of the motherland has entered a new stage .
against such a backdrop , it is very essential for the chinese government to release the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue . "
these " three ifs " clearly announces the preconditions that will force us into adopting drastic measures , including the use of force . this is in fact our " cards in hand . "
on the issue related to the principle of the motherland 's reunification , we resolutely cannot compromise and make a concession .
the meeting participants also pointed out that the release of the white paper is a timely warning to taiwan 's separatist forces .
the release of the white paper is conducive to defending the interest of the country and people ; peaceful settlement of the taiwan issue ; and prompting the international community to understand and handle relevant issues on the one - china principle .
some of the military experts participating in the meeting said : after the release of the white paper , as soldiers , we feel that the responsibility shouldered by the people 's army is extremely heavy .
we must watch closely the development of the taiwan situations and make our contributions toward safeguarding the reunification of the motherland .
( 1 ) in the summer of 1997 , a strange phenomenon emerged time and again in the beijiao office of the shunde city branch of the people 's construction bank of china in guangdong : the customers could not withdraw cash from their savings passbook at the bank .
realizing the seriousness of the problem , the responsible person of the shunde city branch of people 's construction bank of china reported the case to the public security organs at once .
by the time the case was exposed , the company had failed to repay deposits totaling some 6.9 billion yuan .
being aware of his serious crime , zhang changli , director and concurrently general manager of huali enterprise company ltd . and also the prime suspect of the case of illegally absorbing deposits in public , immediately and secretly fled the country , carrying with him some funds .
by the end of april 1999 , the public security organs had already found clues and learned that zhang changli had moved about in southeast asia with a forged western samoan passport .
on the early morning of 5 may , no sooner had the lane with zhang changli on board landed at an airport in a certain southeast asian country than our country 's public security personnel , who had been waiting at the airport , captured him .
on 7 may , helped by the police of the country concerned , they escorted zhang changli back to china .
( 2 ) zhang changli had risen as leader of an enterprise run by the people during the big tide of market economy .
where could he raise such a huge amount of funds within a short period of time ?
by so doing , huali enterprise company ltd . would obtain funds and the beijiao office of people 's construction bank of china would fulfill its deposit quota assigned by the higher authorities .
in april 1995 , zhang changli sent people to spread the word in the society that " science and technology network under the spark program " would raise funds at higher interest between 18% and 36% .
within a short space of two - odd years , the units and individuals from anhui , jiangxi , shaanxi , hubei , hainan , guangdong , and some other provinces gradually deposited funds into their savings accounts at the beijiao office of people 's construction bank of china .
the bank also issued savings deposit certificates to its customers and the customers to sign a written pledge , promising not to withdraw their " deposits " within a certain period of time .
in handling the " deposits , " huali enterprise company ltd . paid part of the higher interest to the customers in advance , promising to repay both the principal and the remaining interest to the customers who produce the deposit passbook to the bank on the agreed date .
later on , he yingzhi asked the staff of the beijiao office of people 's construction bank of china to transfer without a passbook the funds into an account held by huali enterprise company ltd . in violation of the financial management system .
by september 1997 when the case was exposed , huali enterprise company ltd . had illegally raised as much as some 13.5 billion yuan in this way .
however , due to blind investment , zhang changli failed to achieve the expected high yields with the huge amount of funds he had raised with the result that huali enterprise company ltd . ran into financial difficulties .
finally , the plot came to light .
( 3 ) as the violators of law shall be punished , zhang changli has been punished in accordance with the law in the end .
nevertheless , zhang changli 's case of illegally absorbing deposits in public laid bare quite a few problems which have provided much food for thought .
moreover , the process of illegally absorbing deposits in public also very often gives rise to other economic crimes .
originally , some enterprises or financial departments hope to rapidly coordinate funds . however , such a highly risky and illegal practice is bound to open a huge loophole in capital without exception sooner or later and a snowballing effect is likely to aggravate the malpractice further .
in order to block up a loophole , some people are bound to be tempted to commit bribery , graft , or swindle or engage in more serious criminal activities .
the state shall protect the legitimate income of individual citizens or units only and shall choose legitimate savings methods or other legitimate investment methods only .
though it was not at all clever , the method chosen by zhang changli and others had time and again succeeded and had been well received by some people . why ?
the net of justice is wide but not loose .
statistics showed that in 1999 public security organs across the country seized a total of more than 110,000 economic criminals and captured more than 20 suspects of economic crimes from nine foreign countries or overseas regions .
guizhou , an inland province , is not along a border , river , or sea . owing to the effects of natural , geographical , and historical factors , guizhou has lagged behind in economic and social development for a long time .
the area of the province is 170,000 square kilometers , 97 percent of which are lofty ridges and towering mountains .
liu fangren believed : the key factors restricting the development of guizhou are poor transport facilities and inadequate information .
in recent years , the provincial party committee and the provincial government have been exerting themselves to carry out the construction of highways , railways , airports , water transport , and other infrastructure facilities . in guizhou , historic changes are taking place in transportation .
the construction of the chongqing - huaihua railway , which will go through guizhou 's tongren prefecture , is expected to be started this year .
by 2002 guizhou will become the province with the highest railway density in the western region .
the guizhou plateau is the watershed between the two major river systems of chang jiang and zhu jiang .
strengthening the protection of ecological environment and controlling soil erosion are an important task in implementing guizhou 's strategy for sustainable development , which also has a bearing on the overall situation in " lasting stability " in the vast lower reaches of chang jiang and zhu jiang .
at present , stress is to be laid on returning the reclaimed sloping land above 35 degrees to what it was .
corruption is an inevitable issue that puzzles every country in today 's world including china , a developing country that is in the stage of big reform .
the reason why anti - corruption is still one of the major issues of the two plenary sessions of the npc and cppcc this year is because it is often discussed but remains a new topic and because it cannot be accomplished only at one stroke .
premier zhu rongji pointed out at the meeting that our government is the people 's government and being honest and incorruptible is the basic requirement .
it was an important statement on this issue from the head of the government before the two plenary sessions of the npc and cppcc .
taking a broad view of the work of anti - corruption in 1999 , we may say that considerable results have been achieved .
the policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .
the work of setting up a visible construction market was further carried forward . visible construction markets were set up at all cities at region level and above except 14 that were approved not to be built , which effectively controlled corrupt dealings in building projects .
positive results were achieved in carrying forward the government purchasing system , account appointment system , audit system of economic responsibility of leading cadres during their tenures , as well as the system of open village work , open factory work , and open government work .
the roots of corruption lie in the lack of effective power supervision while strong administrative power is one of the important factors that guarantee high efficiency of administration . whether to accept or reject power supervision should depend on the national conditions .
anti - corruption will remain as one of those hot topics in the chinese society for a long time .
beijing , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - the central military commission sponsored a lecture on high - tech knowledge in beijing today .
zhang wannian , member of the political bureau and the secretariat of the cpc central committee and vice chairman of the central military commission , presided over and addressed the lecture .
fu quanyou and xu caihou , members of the central military commission , attended the lecture .
to solve the problems of " winning in war and being immune to degeneration " we must carry out chairman jiang 's important instructions on arming the pla with scientific theories and high - tech knowledge .
we should take full advantage of network techniques and strive to improve the results and efficiency of our learning scientific theories and high - tech knowledge .
to do a good job in arming ourselves with scientific theories is the ideological basis and important guarantee for " being immune to degeneration . "
zhang wannian emphasized : to do a good job in arming the pla with high - tech knowledge is a pressing need and important guarantee for " winning in war . "
chairman jiang has been calling on the pla to thoroughly learn high - tech knowledge and comprehensively apply science and technology in military training .
his call is based on a long - range strategic consideration .
all pla units must study to acquire high - tech knowledge and enhance their capability to win in a high - tech war .
the leading cadres at all levels in the pla must study to gain high - tech knowledge and enhance their ability of commanding and winning in a high - tech war .
in learning high - tech knowledge , the central military commission and all pla general departments should take the lead in creating a common practice and persist in study to spur on all pla units .
we must take the study of high - tech knowledge as a long - term and urgent strategic task and perform it persistently .
the leaders of the four pla general departments , major pla units in beijing , the armed police force , and the general office of the central military commission .
ding guangen , member of the political bureau and member of the secretariat of the cpc central committee and chairman of the central commission for guiding the spiritual civilization building , presided over and spoke at the meeting .
ding guangen pointed out : attaching great importance to the ideological and political work is a fine tradition and a political advantage of our party .
he emphasized : the more we are engaged in deepening reform and expanding the scope of opening up and the more we are engaged in developing a socialist market economy , the greater a stress we should lay on the need to reinforce the work in this aspect .
we should stress this point frequently and repeatedly among the whole party , especially among our leading cadres .
ding guangen further pointed out : we need to base our efforts on the grassroots level when carrying out the task of strengthening and improving our ideological and political work .
we should closely integrate the ideological and political work with every aspect of our professional work , closely integrate solutions to ideological problems with solutions to practical problems , and closely integrate the need of educating the masses with the need of serving the masses .
we should reinforce the ideological work among young students , create a sound atmosphere for a healthy mental and physical growth of teenagers and youths , help them establish correct ideals and convictions , and reinforce their concept of observing discipline and the law .
it is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well - being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .
communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .
we should organize the writing of a number of articles which carry a lot of weight and show depth of thought , so as to provide the masses with clearly aimed and persuasive answers to the questions that they are most concerned .
we should publish a number of good books and produce good films and tv programs , so that we can exert a favorable influence on people 's character , make entertainment a medium of education , and enrich the cultural life of the masses .
exhibition halls , museums , science parks , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots should all become positions for the building of a socialist spiritual civilization .
members of the central commission for guiding the spiritual civilization building attended today 's meeting .
special article by zts reporter lin ying ( 2651 7751 ) : " prc will usher in another wave of foreign investment a chinese expert recently forecast that china will usher in a new wave of foreign investment after its accession to the wto this year .
according to the recent statistics of the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation , up to the end of 1999 , foreign - invested enterprises approved to set up in china exceeded 340,000 , and the foreign capital actually used amounted to $ 307.8 billion .
last year , foreign capital actually used still maintained a considerable scale , reaching $ 40.39 billion , making the prc second only to the united states in the world in absorbing foreign investment for six years in a row .
china 's positive use of foreign capital has played an enormous role in promoting the national economic growth , precipitating the development of import and export trade , and increasing the number of people having found jobs .
the statistics demonstrates that last year alone , the total import and export amount of the foreign - invested enterprises reached 174.5 billion , increasing by 10.7 percent over the previous year , and accounting for 48.8 percent of the total import and export amount of the entire country .
last year , the number of people employed by the foreign - invested enterprises accounted for more than 15 percent of the non - agricultural population across the country .
affected by the lagging effect of the asian financial crisis , foreign capital actually used by china last year was nearly $ 40.4 billion , decreasing by 9.7 percent over the previous year , and showing negative growth for the first time in many years .
3 ) the founding of the regional bloc has expanded the internal capital flow , and particularly the activation of euro has accelerated the capital movement among the countries of the eu but relatively restrained the eu 's funds flowing from europe into other countries .
moreover , the improvement of the economy in europe has attracted a large amount of funds flowing into the eu countries , which has affected the investment in china with international funds .
4 ) the slowdown of china 's domestic demand and the comparatively rapid wage increase in the coastal developed areas have , to a certain extent , crippled the power of the china market to attract foreign capital .
nevertheless , the expert pointed out that the emergence of economic recovery in various asian countries and regions such as hong kong , rok , japan , and southeast asian countries would once again contribute to an increase of investment in china in 2000 .
along with its accession to the wto , china will open more domains to the outside world .
this new round of opening - up moves will provide new opportunities for foreign investors , thereby setting off another wave of foreign investment in china .
a magnificent full - strength sea drill organized by a certain submarine unit marked the beginning of the people 's navy 's massive scientific and technological training this year .
for three years running since 1997 , this unit has been rated as an advanced unit in naval military training .
not long ago , the general staff department circulated a notice of commendation on their advanced deeds .
today , the generals were going to greet the underwater pride of the republic who came back in triumph from the " underwater long march . "
at 1000 , the officers and men of a certain submarine were steering the iron long whale slowly into the military port after fighting with the stormy sea for dozens of days and nights .
have not seen you for a long while , my dear ones !
have not seen you for a long while , motherland !
staring at the five - star red flag fluttering high above the military port , the officers and men could not help but have their eyes fill with tears .
this submarine is a piece of new main - battle equipment developed by our country .
in order to test its performance and underwater strike capability and test the combat strength and survival capability of officers and men , this submarine , with the central military commission 's authorization , carried out the special task of an " underwater long march . "
" the success of this long voyage will become an important symbol of the people 's navy 's modernization drive . "
prior to setting sail , vice admiral shi yunsheng , commander of the navy , issued a marching order to the officers and men going on the long voyage .
underwater long march is a matter of life and death .
this is a test of the ultimate limit of the submarine , the crew , and the weapons .
at that moment , liu guangyou , commander of the voyage and chief of the unit , was as excited as anybody else .
as the oldest crew member and the supreme commander of this long voyage , the great effort he made is something conceivable .
however , just when the submarine was heading towards the motherland , liu guangyou suddenly issued an order of " extending the long voyage for five more days . "
but as a commander , he was more preoccupied with the thoughts that his unit should take advantage of the long voyage to undergo rigorous training close to actual combat .
at the mobilization meeting , liu guangyou said in a resounding voice : " if we stay one more minute under the sea , we will be a bit more certain of winning a naval war .
at this crucial moment of being put to the test by the party and the people , we must give a satisfactory answer ! "
upon approval of its request by the higher authorities , the submarine continued its long voyage .
" put the helm fully to port , twin screws up by two ! "
the submarine sailed deep down in the ocean again .
that day , the sea was overcast by dense fog , with less than 100 meters of visibility .
the higher authorities ordered the submarine to launch a torpedo attack on an " enemy " frigate .
following submarine captain liu zimin 's " fire ! " order , two new torpedoes rushed straight to the target and buried the " enemy " frigate on the seabed .
the sun quietly rose above the horizon , and the submarine was slowly rising to the surface .
on the quay , welcoming bunting fluttered in the breeze and the celebrating sound of gongs and drums resounded through the sea and the sky .
with chest and head high , the officers and men stepped down from the submarine in proper order .
looking at the emaciated , unshaven faces and holding greasy dirt - stained hands , the generals were in tears .
over the past 20 years , this submarine unit has successively organized dozens of oceangoing voyages , with all of its submarines having gone through the test of pacific storms , and set dozens of records in the building history of submarine units of the people 's navy .
science and technology training as the pioneer entering into this submarine unit , people will immediately sense the strong atmosphere of mass science and technology training . with a deeper understanding , people will praise , from the bottom of their hearts , what the unit has achieved !
in june 1999 , a professor from the naval submarine academy specially came to a certain submarine to ask noncommissioned officer [ nco ] wang changlai about the operating procedure of a certain new type of torpedo and invite him to compile together teaching material for using the torpedo .
there is nothing new for this unit that college professors specially come for advice and equipment specialists come to ask for assistance in tackling difficult problems .
wang changlai , 42 , is the most senior submarine nco of the navy .
over the past 20 - plus years , he , through assiduous self - study , has mastered the professional skills of firing four models of submarine torpedoes and become a " soldier professor " of high - tech equipment .
in recent years , wang changlai has trained 300 - odd key torpedo specialists , and the incumbent torpedo squad leader of the unit was his " student " as well .
sonar is the " ear " of a submarine .
after becoming a sonar soldier , chou yuping is well aware of his heavy responsibility .
in daytime , he listened to recordings at the trainer 's room ; at night , he laid on his bed to listen to his own pulse ; when he went to sea , he practiced how to distinguish the noise of various sea and undersea targets .
a year later , he became very skillful in " determining what it is just by listening " .
last october , chou yuping stayed in a submarine for six days and nights to ambush up to 100 batches of sea and undersea targets , and every time he identified the targets accurately .
chou yuping has also compiled a two - volume " sonar operation manual " and published three academic theses .
the research and development program for a " logical - memory sonar tracking device " proposed by him draws much attention from sonar experts .
" as long as you are on active service , you have to think , rack your brains , be engaged in modernization " , this is the unit 's party committee 's demand on officers and men .
in 1999 alone , the unit made over 160 scientific and technological innovations .
submarine torpedo nco zheng wenfa boldly suggested the research and development of a set of new equipment for simulated submarine torpedo attack training .
upon getting the unit leadership 's approval , he began his hard struggle .
one time , he worked nine days and nights without a letup debugging a software program .
a year later , when zheng wenfa connected his newly - developed simulator with the torpedo attack director , they were incompatible .
he did not flinch from the failure .
he successively went to science research institutes in beijing and then shanghai to ask experts for advice and gather information , made 30 - plus major changes in the design plan , and eventually solved the difficult problem of compatibility between the simulator and the director .
this set of simulated equipment filled a gap of new - model submarine training and , after putting to use , saved the state several million yuan of training expenses .
on 9 october 1998 , 30 - odd experts and professors at home were in beijing to hold , for the first time ever , a high - level scientific and technological achievement authentication meeting for a submarine soldier .
soon afterwards , the navy formally reported this achievement to higher authorities as winner of the army 's science and technology progress class two award .
the south china sea , stormy sea and rapid waves .
following a several thousands nautical miles long - range raid , a new - model submarine led by unit chief liu guangyou , came here to take part in a real - strength drill on an unprecedented scale .
the submarine lay in ambush under the sea for five consecutive days and nights to launch 12 long - range torpedo attacks on " enemy " naval vessels and submarines , directly hitting the targets 11 times .
on the evening when the exercise was over , the moon cast its bright reflection in the water .
liu guangyou looked on the waves and could not sleep all night long .
what the exercise headquarters ' citation telegram brought him was not only joy .
at that moment , it was pressure that liu guangyou , who had gone to military academies four times for further studies and taken submarines to oceangoing voyages for a dozen times , felt the strongest .
in january 1999 , the unit 's party committee held three enlarged meetings to promote science and technology training .
at the meetings , liu guangyou unequivocally noted : " method of operation is the key to fighting for the battlefield initiative .
we can get it as long as we use our strong points to attack the enemy 's weak links ! "
" our sword may not necessarily be as good as others ' , but we must brandish our sword in a way better than others ! "
political commissar huang yaonian hit the mark with a single comment .
" torpedo attack has three great risks , how to tackle that ? "
unit chief liu guangyou and political commissar huang yaonian said to submarine captains on many occasions : combat opportunities and risks coexist in high - tech war . in order to seize combat opportunities in future sea war , it is worth to take some risks now .
you just go ahead boldly , we will hold ourselves responsible if there is anything wrong ! "
on this basis , they organized officers and men to carry out simulated training more than 100 times .
on the vast sea , the clouds were moving fast and the waves were roaring .
a formation of " enemy " vessels entered a sea area where we were lying in ambush .
with the suddenness of a thunderbolt , two of our submarines launched a preemptive attack on the " enemy . "
new - model torpedoes were fired one after another to blow the " enemy " vessels to pieces .
the new method of operation via large firing - range torpedo attack won the first battle , with the time of attack shortened by half compared with the past while the range of attack increased by several times !
to create a new method of operation that can win future high - tech war , we must not only take risks but also endure setbacks and failures .
being conditioned by its equipment performance , a certain type of submarine can only lay mines in shallow waters .
with the needs of actual warfare as the point of departure , leaders of the unit decided to implement a plan where the fully - loaded submarine would lay mines in great depth .
according to this plan , the mine - laying depth would be several times greater than normal .
however , the first great - depth mine - laying attempt failed !
the second one failed again !
" great - depth mine - laying is good for hiding , we cannot give it up . "
" in order to win tomorrow , we must readily endure the pain of failure today ! "
unit leaders and grass - roots officers and men gradually came to a common understanding , and drills on this new method of operation went on .
a new drill began .
the submarine went deep down the sea , 20 meters , 30 meters , 40 meters ...
submarine captain yang huaijun decisively issued a " mine - laying " order .
in an instant , dozens of mines deep down the sea erected a protective screen that enemy vessels found it difficult to cross over .
the new submarine 's first great - depth fully - loaded mine - laying was a complete success !
victory belongs to trailblazers bold in making innovations .
in 1999 , this underwater mighty force achieved repeated successes in drills organized for various new methods of operation , including attack , mine - laying , and anti - submarine .
all these successes indicate that the people 's navy 's submarine unit has the extraordinary capability to attack its opponents !
li dezhu called on nationalities affairs commissions at all levels to take the opportunity of the large - scale development of the western region to change their concepts , work style , and work mode , and liberate themselves from their conventional and habitual work mode .
li dezhu emphasized that in the large - scale development of the western region , it is necessary to uphold " five principles . "
first , it is necessary to uphold the principle that development is the primary orientation and solidarity is a guarantee .
in the meantime , it is necessary to work conscientiously to properly complete current jobs .
regarding the challenges and how to formulate countermeasures , these reporters interviewed li chunting , a responsible person of the bank of agricultural development 's [ bad ] branch organ in henan province , a major agricultural province ; this bank mainly provides services to agriculture .
li chunting said in accordance with the " global financial service trades accord , " all member states must open up their financial services market at an appropriate time and in all - round fashion .
the development course of many foreign policy - style banks in switching from single to comprehensive business proves this point .
hence , li chunting believes that to adapt to the requirements of wto accession , the bad must provide strong financial backing for the state in building a highly effective and secure grain and cotton reserve system .
in an open market environment , the government will mainly depend on the levels of the special reserves of grain , cotton , and other major agricultural products in exercising macroeconomic regulation and control over these commodities .
judging by current conditions in china , a grain reserve on an initial scale has formed due to the recent bumper harvests and the implementation of the policy of open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain .
the amount of these reserves has already reached the 17 to 18 percent proportion laid down by the un food and agriculture organization .
however , since china is a large agricultural country with a big population , there is a certain gap between our current reserve capacity and regulation and control measures on the one hand and our national condition on the other .
the bad must continue to provide great support for the procurement , storage , transfer and sale , import and export , and construction of storage facilities for the special reserve grain and cotton , and also do a good job in providing the relevant services .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao 22 february stated in explicit terms that china has no intention to attend the g-8 summit and its related activities .
german chancellor gerhard schroder said : " judging from a medium - range point of view , i think we should seriously consider the question of whether or not china 's joining g-8 is meaningful . "
when he visited china in november last year , he expressed the intention of asking china to join g-8 .
french president jacques chirac said : " in view of the fact that china has become a main force in preserving world stability , i am personally in favor of inviting china to join g-8 and forming a group of 9 . "
therefore , china is necessary to express its own point of view .
china has repeatedly expressed that it has no intention to attend the g-8 summit and its related activities .
people all know the position and views of china toward asia - pacific affairs and other major international issues .
the chinese side wants to emphasize that the important role of the united nations [ un ] and the united nations security council [ unsc ] in international affairs cannot be replaced .
the remarks by the chinese foreign ministry 's spokesman were quite equivocal . he emphatically pointed out the important and desirable role of the un .
people can remember that , last summer , following nato 's fierce air attacks against yugoslavia , g-8 were especially active and people saw an abnormal situation and were worried .
later , while the goal of fierce air attacks could not be reached , the us - led nato further used g-8 to mediate the kosovo crisis .
on 6 may last year , foreign ministers of g-8 adopted a general principle on political solution of the kosovo crisis before the un made a resolution .
china cannot accept this kind of practice .
china is one of the five permanent members of the unsc with veto power on major issues .
g-8 bypassing the unsc to act last year was in effect bypassing china and weaken china 's legitimate rights to take part and exert its influence on major international affairs .
therefore , since last year , china has actively sought measures to alter this unfavorable situation in order to protect china 's interests .
on the one side , china has made efforts to protect the legality and authority of un and to reaffirm the correct track of handling world affairs by un at an earlier date .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao not long ago noted that china attaches importance to the role of g-8 , is willing to strengthen exchange and cooperation with g-8 and hopes the host country will continue to inform china about their meetings before and after those meetings .
however , regarding certain g-8 members ' inviting china to attend the g-8 summit in the capacity of an observer or formally join g-8 , it is indeed a very complicated question .
in this way , china can expand its space of diplomatic activities , increase room for maneuver , further strengthen china 's position as a big country , reduce unfavorable factors and protect national interests to the maximum .
it appears that china will think more about the overall interests of the world and politely decline invitations to attend or join the g-8 .
china 's pork and eggs respectively account for 46 and 38 percent of the world 's totals ; china is indeed a major country for animal products , but not a power .
this is because the fact that china ranks first in the world in this meat and eggs only refers to the amount ; china is also the most populous country in the world , and the consumption level per capital remains very low .
we must therefore strive to enhance the market competitiveness of our livestock industry .
i would like to analyze and probe this question here .
in particular , in some coastal provinces half the peasants no longer raised pigs and chickens , while there also emerged households or villages specializing in the livestock industry , with households raising 100 pigs and 1,000 chickens .
specialized livestock industry became still more prominent in the 1990's , and the status of this industry gradually rose from a former household sideline occupation to an industry with extraordinary vitality and relative independence .
the integration and industrialization of livestock raising also led forward and spurred the regionalization of the livestock industry and its formation into large scale .
pig - raising has developed rapidly in sichuan and hunan , and these two provinces rank first and second in pork production .
this policy , however , led to seriously irrational distribution of animal products between the urban and rural areas , and there were many mistakes in taking simultaneous account of the interests of the agricultural producers and those of the urban consumers .
the procurement policies for the main animal products were abolished in 1985 , and the basic role of the market in resource allocation was gradually brought into play .
the supply and marketing cooperatives have consistently taken part in handling animal products , but the biggest change after the reform compared with previously was that they changed from being purchasing agents into undertakings truly making their own decisions .
the original foreign trade and state - run and cooperative commerce undertakings mentioned above expanded from circulation to the processing of animal products and livestock and poultry production and integrated operations , in order to consolidate their position and develop and boost their strength in handling animal products .
there is also another force , that is , the livestock breeding - industry - commerce companies at various levels , a new force which was separated from the agriculture and livestock administrative and management departments and directly engaged in livestock raising , processing , and sales .
they emerged in the years when procurement quotas were still being set for the main animal products ; they broke through the old pattern of only engaging in the livestock industry , and were the first modern enterprises to carry out integrated production and sales of animal products .
this way of doing things achieved the dovetailing of scattered production with concentrated sales markets , reduced the links in the circulation chain , lowered circulation losses , and acted as a tremendous boost to developing the livestock industry .
although the degree of organization of individual transport was low , and there were even problems of abnormal operational behavior , it could succeed in complementing other circulation channels .
some which have developed relatively well have succeeded in integrating production , processing , and sales and in industrialized operations .
scattered stockraising is the main component , but the proportion of self - consumption by the producers is also high ; making a comparison , the amount of commodities provided to society by big producers and large - scale stockraising farms occupies a decisive position .
the switch of the livestock industry from scattered and extensive stockraising to large - scale stockraising , and from a family sideline undertaking to an intensive and modernized form is also a switch from traditional to modern economy .
this played a stimulating role in china 's use of advanced foreign technology , in the development of factory - style and modern pig - raising , and in enhancing livestock production levels .
as a result of the construction of several " shopping basket programs , " livestock and poultry production bases have extended from the inner to the outer outskirts of cities and into neighboring provinces , and this accords with the laws of the development of productive forces .
compared with pork and eggs , however , it is a " little brother . "
in accordance with china 's national condition and with reference to foreign experiences , in the next 10 years , and even throughout the entire 21st century , china 's livestock industry should focus on developing table hens and dairy products .
the government at all levels should raise table hens and the dairy industry to an important position , and give these great support as key industries . 1 .
china 's chicken meat output accounts for only about 12 percent of its total meat output , while chicken accounts for 23 percent of world meat production .
the production cycle of table hens in short , the fodder conversion rate is high , and chicken prices are the cheapest on the international market , where consumption has registered a big increase .
china exports less than 300,000 tons of table hens a year , while the united states exports 2 million tons , and that country , brazil , france , and the netherlands export a total of over 3.5 million tons a year .
the main producing areas for table hens in china are the outskirts of several large cities and a few provinces and municipalities including shandong , jilin , hebei , and henan .
table hen production in beijing started in the mid-1960's , and at that time it was mainly supplied for export .
most projects such as shandong 's zhucheng , shanghai 's dajiang , and jilin 's deda companies were set up in order to export , but the proportion of exports is still not very high .
strengthen the dairy industry , the weakest point china leads the world in several aspects of the livestock industry , but its weakest point is dairy products .
and more and more adults are eating meat and eggs every day , but milk has not yet become a staple for them .
yet milk is gradually being accepted by middle - aged and older people as a replenisher of calcium , and this also comprises part of a stable consumer market .
milk and milk products can only increase year on year .
developing the livestock industry is for the sake of improving living standards and improving the people 's physique ; at the same time the livestock industry solves the job problem for 80 million laborers , and is a major industry for increasing peasant incomes .
the domestic consumption market for animal products is very great .
beijing , 23 feb (zxs) - - today , this staff reporter learned from the eu representative office in china that china and the eu will continue negotiations on china 's accession to the world trade organization on 24 february .
the current negotiations , which are consultations on technical issues , began on 21 february and were originally scheduled to last two to three days .
by the time this reporter filed this dispatch at 1715 [ 0915 gmt ] today , neither side had disclosed whether the negotiations had made any progress .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has said that , if the negotiations make major progress , he will " hop on an airplane " later this week to fly to beijing to sign a final agreement with the chinese side .
beijing , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - from 21 to 22 february , chinese assistant foreign minister wang yi and vietnamese assistant foreign minister le cong phung held the seventh round of sino - vietnamese government - level talks on border issues in beijing .
wang yi and le cong phung also held annual consultations on foreign affairs and exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern .
on 22 february , chinese vice foreign minister yang wenchang met le cong phung 's delegation and attended a ceremony on signing the " summary of minutes " of the seventh round of sino - vietnamese government - level talks on border issues .
vietnamese ambassador to china bui hong phuc attended the meeting and the signing ceremony .
at the start of the new year , the public security contingent building , a long - standing focus of attention of all walks of life in the society , has made a major stride forward .
in order to grasp problems on an earlier date , we should work hard to identify and tackle problems of tendencies and symptoms of problems and exert our utmost to resolve the problems in the embryonic stage .
beijing , 23 feb - - chinese and european union [ eu ] representatives will continue talks today on china 's wto accession .
an official from the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation [ moftec ] here indicated that the two sides are still in talks on technical issues , adding that so far no breakthrough has been made .
he remained optimistic about the prospects for the negotiations , however .
when asked whether the focus of the negotiations was on telecommunications issues , the official said that it was not completely true .
he noted that since the two sides remain divided on certain technical problems and have not dealt with core issues , it is hard to tell when this round of talks will end .
it is noteworthy that both sides have attached great importance to the negotiations .
the representatives of the two sides were still at the negotiating table at 1830 hours .
the moftec official held that though not as arduous as sino - us negotiations , this round of talks is by no means easy .
apart from the eu , there are still 10 - odd countries that have not signed bilateral agreements with china .
the official noted that china 's talks with other countries are less difficult when compared to its negotiations with the eu . china may encounter some obstacles in talks with latin american nations , however .
in spite of this , the official remained optimistic about china 's wto accession within a year .
the publication of this white paper has evoked strong repercussions in the international community .
it is , therefore , necessary to understand the timing and great significance of the publication of the white paper .
in august 1993 , the taiwan affairs office and information office of the state council issued a white paper , entitled " the taiwan issue and china 's reunification . "
over the past seven years , tremendous changes have taken place in the domestic and international situation .
given such a background , obviously it is extremely necessary and timely for beijing to release the white paper on the taiwan issue .
running through the whole white paper is a central theme , that is , the one - china principle is the basis and precondition for realizing peaceful reunification .
why is it necessary to launch the struggle against the " two states " theory ?
this is because the " two states " theory has undermined the development of cross - strait relations , as well as the basis and precondition for peaceful reunification .
if lee teng - hui is allowed to pursue the " two states " theory and even turn it into a policy of the newly elected leader of taiwan , the basis for peaceful reunification will no longer exist .
thanks to the resolute struggle waged by the mainland side , the taiwan authorities could not but announce that the " two states " theory will not be " incorporated into the constitution , " nor has it been turned into a major policy keynote in the present election .
taiwan is an inalienable part of china . this is the consensus of the entire chinese people .
only through reunification can the chinese nation rejuvenate itself comprehensively .
any attempt to separate taiwan from china will bring disasters to taiwan .
" independence for taiwan " means war [ zhan zheng 2069 3630 ] and the destruction of the basis for peaceful reunification .
the white paper has explicitly spelled out the three preconditions under which the chinese government will be forced to use force to resolve the taiwan issue . this is the bottom line of the policy of the chinese government .
it will enable the people of taiwan to make a clear distinction between right and wrong , work for peaceful reunification , and opt for peaceful reunification rather than war .
all this reflects the chinese government 's stand to resolutely safeguard the one - china principle .
they should not talk nonsense with regard to the taiwan issue or encourage " taiwan independence , " much less should they underestimate the chinese people 's determination and capability to safeguard china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve total reunification .
may i ask how you analyze the process and characteristics of such a " progressive reform " ?
as everybody knows , china 's reform has attracted worldwide attention for its tremendous successes .
the " progressive reform " has presented two most prominent characteristics as follows : first , we carried out reform while pushing forward rapid economic development with the energy released from the reform .
during the 20 years of reform , china 's gdp grew by 9.8 percent each year on average , three times the world average , and the people 's living standards were markedly enhanced .
second , we carried out reform while making exploration , so that we have had a clearer direction , repeatedly reached a consensus in understanding , reduced social tremors , increased our ability to resist risks , and achieved the overall unity of reform , development , and stability .
then , what do you think are the principal contradictions and problems in the course of the " progressive reform " ?
in this double - track stage , the structural loopholes and the friction of contradictions between the new and old structures will inevitably give rise to a series of social contradictions and negative phenomena .
therefore , i think that it is impossible for two different operational mechanisms and rules to exist in a unified social economic structure for a long time .
moreover , these problems cannot completely disappear by means of education , supervision , and even crackdown .
only after the new structure comes into shape and the old structure basically withdraws from the historical scene through in - depth reform can the problems be fundamentally resolved .
otherwise , the contradictions in this double - track stage will continue to accumulate and thus increase the difficulties and costs of the reform .
nie : according to the analyses you have just made of the stages of the " progressive reform , " we are now in the stage of storming the heavily fortified positions , which means changing from the old structure to the new one .
ordinarily , various kinds of social contradictions are very conspicuous , but why does everybody , from top to bottom , emphasize that the key point of storming the fortified positions of reform lies in the reform of state - owned enterprises ?
zang : the state - owned enterprises were the foundation of the planned economic structure , and also the focal point of various contradictions .
its changes directly touched the deep - level contradictions of the old structure ( including the traditional concepts ) .
since the mid - nineties , the reform of the state - owned enterprises has made an important step , but it has not effected a total qualitative leap .
it is still a rather long distance from the establishment of a property rights boundary and interest boundary of multiple input , as well as from an explicit market main body and legal entity as required by the modern enterprise system .
it is precisely because of this that the problem of state enterprise reform has for the first time become the central committee plenum 's principal subject for discussion .
nie : in your opinion , how should we face and solve such numerous thorny problems , including the state enterprise reform , at this stage of storming the fortified positions of reform ?
zang : according to my macroscopic ideas on reform , we should have a good grasp of the following relationships : 1 .
the relationship between reform and development .
reform is the motive force of development , and provides service and a sound , effective mechanism to development .
however , reform cannot replace development , so we should pay serious attention to the issue of industrial structural adjustment and upgrading .
moreover , if we grasp the industrial structural adjustment and upgrading without carrying on reform , we will lack internal economic vitality , intensify administrative intervention consciously or unconsciously , and therefore fail to achieve our anticipated results .
just as comrade xiaoping said : reform and opening up is a move that will determine china 's destiny , to which we must keep a clear head . 2 .
the relationship between the realization forms of the public ownership and the development of nonpublic economies .
at present , china 's huge state - owned economy needs the participation of the considerable number of nonpublic economic sectors to bring about such a change . hence , we should encourage the development of the nonpublic economies . 3 .
the relationship between the structural changes of enterprises and the intensification of their internal management .
intensification of management is an eternal theme of enterprises .
the question is what we should depend upon to arouse the initiative of the enterprises ' internal management .
in the final analysis , we need a good structure and mechanism .
that is why departing from reform to grasp management will do in a small number of enterprises but will not do in a majority of them ; and it will work for a short period of time but will not work for a long time .
in short , we should not forget that " reform is the only road for emancipating and developing productive forces . "
we face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .
there are many problems that need studying . the key issue is to strengthen the ideals and beliefs of the broad masses of party members , cadres , and the people through strong and effective ideological and political work .
ideals and beliefs are a practical embodiment of people 's political convictions and world perspectives .
our party 's goal is to realize communism . in the current phase , our party 's goal is to construct socialism with chinese characteristics .
firm ideals and beliefs are the soul of communists . they are the spiritual pillar and source of energy for communists who never stop struggling , and no sooner does one of them fall than another steps into the breach .
in the revolutionary period and in wartime , based on their firm ideals and beliefs , millions of revolutionaries withstood severe trials of blood and fire and of life and death and ushered in the birth of a new china .
history proves that , with communist ideals and beliefs , the whole party , the whole army and the entire nation with its different ethnic origins will have a direction to march forward to victory , will have indomitable willpower , endless strength and courage to overcome all difficulties .
li hongzhi 's crooked reasoning and heretical ideas were believed by many people . this is because falungong and li hongzhi took advantage of the moral vacuum , knowing that some of us led a life devoid of meaning and our ideals and beliefs wavered .
president jiang repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must pay attention to politics .
people 's ideals and beliefs are basic politics .
without firm ideals and beliefs , we cannot have correct a political direction , political stance or political viewpoints . without firm ideals and beliefs , we cannot have strong political discipline , the ability to distinguish between good and bad political phenomena , or political sensibility .
if our ideals and beliefs waver , it is impossible for us to maintain our political steadfastness .
so , strengthening and improving ideological and political work while focusing on strengthening people 's ideals and beliefs is an arduous and urgent task faced by party committees and political units at all levels .
we must give no opportunity to non - marxist and anti - marxist elements . communist ideals and beliefs are based on dialectical materialism and historical materialism .
they can only be established through long - term study and putting into practice what they study .
to strengthen our ideals and beliefs , the most basic issue is that we must strengthen the study of marxism , leninism , mao zedong thought and , especially , deng xiaoping theory .
only marxism can lead us to deeply understand the objective laws of social development , grasp the nature of the development of the world 's situation , and not be influenced by whirlpools and adverse currents in the river of history .
because of this , we must treat education in marxist theory as an important task in our ideological and political work and carry it out deeply and forever .
to do well the work of strengthening our ideals and beliefs , we must correctly deal with the relationship between our ideals and interests .
in the past , influenced by far - left ideological trends , we indulged in empty talk about our ideals and were forbidden to talk about our interests .
the move is another cornerstone for the strengthening of japan - us military cooperation , and it signifies the military cooperation of the two sides is going deeper .
the first phase is a time for reorientation , beginning from us president clinton 's visit to japan in april 1996 .
in this visit , clinton and the then - japanese prime minister hashimoto signed a programmatic document to reinforce the japan - us alliance , that is , " the us - japan joint declaration on security : alliance for the 21st century . "
the declaration redefined the alliance as not limited to the purpose of pure defense , but with an aim to intervene in regional and even global affairs .
this means that the japan - us military alliance will see a change in nature .
the second phase is giving legal status to the alliance .
the governments of japan and the united states released the new " guidelines for japan - us defense cooperation . "
hereafter , once a situation in areas surrounding japan happens , japan will work with the us military in the moves of a military intervention .
this , undoubtedly , has sowed the seeds of misfortune for the security of the region or even the globe .
with the above - mentioned reorientation and legislative guarantee , japan and the united states hurried themselves into the third phase , that is , implementation .
the first big move was to join hands to develop tmd [ theater missile defense ] under the pretext of the " dprk launched a long - range ballistic missile . "
on 16 august 1999 , japan and the united states exchanged notes and signed a memorandum on developing tmd together .
right after that , on 21 august , the japanese defense agency , listed 2.1 billion japanese yen in the budget of 2000 for the single purpose of developing tmd .
then , on 22 october 1999 , the japanese and us governments announced to formally begin research and development of tmd .
according to japanese media , in the next five years , japan and the united states will kick in 50 to 60 billion japanese yen for research and development , and of this amount , japan is responsible for 20 to 30 million japanese yen .
to make the tmd smoothly developed , currently japan and the united states are trying to repudiate the " anti - ballistic missile treaty , " which was regarded as an obstacle by them .
the second big move was deciding to establish the japan - us joint command headquarters .
reportedly , in future japan - us joint military maneuvers , the organ will be responsible for deploying the two armies , collecting information , and stipulating and transmitting joint maneuver plans for logistics support .
it is obvious that the establishment of the new headquarters will move japan - us military cooperation to a newer and higher level .
how it is going to affect the security and stability of japan and " the areas surrounding japan " is self - evident .
all the signs have led to the conclusion that with the establishment of the joint command headquarters , a series of moves will be observed from the japanese - us military cooperation endeavor .
people will wait and see what happens .
instead , the central bank will adopt a more flexible exchange rate system and widen the yuan 's floating scope against the us dollar .
although the yuan exchange rate against the us dollar appeared to be fixed since the beginning of the asian financial crisis , it should not be interpreted as a fixed exchange rate system in the real sense .
the chinese government has never announced any target exchange rate , and therefore is not obliged to maintain the yuan exchange rate at a particular level .
under the current exchange rate system , the trend of the yuan exchange rate against the us dollar is mainly determined by the balance of payments .
in the past few years , the central bank managed to ease the pressure of the yuan 's appreciation by buying surplus us dollar from the foreign exchange center in shanghai .
a surplus in international balance of payments suggests that demand for the us dollar will be smaller than supply and that the pressure of the yuan 's devaluation this year is virtually non - existent .
to the contrary , there will be some pressure of its appreciation .
it is perhaps more appropriate to call the exchange rate the outcome rather than the reason of economic activities .
if this misunderstanding can be righted , the government will be able to win some space for resolving its domestic economic problems .
for example , it can further lower interest rates to stimulate domestic demand without having to worry about the pressure of the yuan 's devaluation .
free convertibility will definitely become a reality in the long term , this also represents the direction for the development of the yuan exchange rate system .
following china 's entry into the wto , the yuan will definitely become freely convertible gradually .
on an operational level , the combination of a more flexible exchange rate system with a more freely convertible foreign exchange system is easier to implement than the combination of a fixed exchange rate system with free convertibility .
this position has remained consistent from then until now , solid and unmoving . we will in no way allow any power to change in any way the status of the resolve that taiwan is one part of china .
during all these years , li denghui has deliberately plotted to break down precisely this one china principle . indeed , the question of whether to uphold or destroy the one china principle is the crux of our struggle with li denghui and the " taiwan independence " forces .
the twists and turns in cross - straits relations over the past five years eloquently demonstrate the prescience and grasp of reality shown by chairman jiang 's proposal .
this is the determining factor , so that even though there are bound to be barriers and obstructions along the road to national unification , any and all attempts to separate taiwan from china will surely fail .
while chairman jiang 's talk was fundamental in setting up the parameters for the solution of the taiwan question , it also demonstrated the inherent flexibility of our strategy and our spirit of engagement .
chairman jiang 's talk set out the essentials of the " peaceful unification , one country , two systems " policy , thereby giving expression to the consistency and continuity of our party and government with respect to solution of the taiwan question .
the successful practice of " one country , two systems " in hong kong and macao confirms that this is the best way of resolving the taiwan question .
this attitude of facing the facts and seeking truth from them shows the great sincerity of our party and government with respect to peaceful unification , and it will surely be embraced by the great majority of taiwan compatriots .
in his talk , chairman jiang made a whole series of fundamental proposals .
peaceful unification demands a long process , and the development of cross - straits relations demands that we create a healthy environment of security .
official conclusion of cross - straits antagonism under the one china principle is an essential step in carrying forward the development of cross - straits relations .
carrying out political negotiations is the key to full - fledged progress in cross - straits relations at the present stage .
any and all issues are negotiable under the one china principle , including all the various issues that are of concern to the taiwan government .
both sides should enter into fair and equitable consultation at the earliest possible date on the issues of the name , venue and format of political negotiations , under the one china principle , and find a means of resolving such issues that is acceptable to both sides .
after the publication of chairman jiang 's talk , it received widespread attention and enthusiastic response both at home and abroad , and this lent significant impetus to the development of cross - straits relations .
as to the question of who is the promoter of the development of cross - straits relations , and who is the destroyer of peaceful unification of the motherland , the answer is there for all the world to see .
if we look back at the long and vast river of history , we can see that preserving national unity has been the governing motive in the development of the chinese nation from its very beginnings until now .
the media and the academic , industrial and business circles on taiwan island have been the most enthusiastic and the most active in expressing their opinions . people are all expecting that the cross - strait relations will continue to develop toward reunification .
the reunification of the motherland accords with the feelings of the people and the general trend of events ; it is where the fundamental interest of all the chinese people , including the people in taiwan , lies ; and it is an irresistible historical trend .
during the five years , the political , economic , social and other achievements made by our country have attracted worldwide attention . we have deepened our reform , increased our strength , raised our international standing , expanded our influence and improved our living standard .
the facts have proven that deng xiaoping 's " one country , two systems " concept has a great vitality and it is the best way to solve the taiwan question .
after the reunification of the motherland , taiwan will certainly enjoy prosperity , stability and even more rapid development , and the people in taiwan will join the people on the mainland in enjoying the dignity and glory of the chinese nation .
at the turn of the century , we sense the heavy responsibility on our shoulders in the march toward a complete reunification of the motherland .
what will be the influence of " entry into wto " on the general level of prices in china ?
wang yang , vice minister of the state planning commission , recently answered the question raised by reporters .
according to the bilateral agreement on joining wto as a member , china 's reduction of tariffs will go through a gradual course and the import of international commodities , which are sold cheaper than domestic products , will also increase gradually year by year .
using the consumer price index will be conducive to conforming with international customs and also conducive to making comparison and analysis with most countries in the world .
the consumer price index can more wholly and truly reflect the actual change of market prices and will be favorable to improving the adjustment and control of the general level of prices .
these measures play an important role in improving the natural environment and promoting the continuous development of the economy and society . however , there are still problems in some areas of cutting trees , using forest lands for unauthorized purposes and damaging forests without restraint .
driven by short - term interests , some areas cut forests and denude areas on the sly . management departments of some areas connive and shield people who cut and steal trees . sometimes management departments even cooperate with people who cut and steal trees .
moreover , some areas will become poor again . so it is imperative and urgent to take effective measures and strengthen law enforcement in order to protect forest resources and improve the natural environment . we must further improve our understanding of the importance of protecting forest resources .
major party and government leaders at all levels must have a high sense of responsibility and the spirit of being responsible for our descendants . they must deeply understand the significance of protecting forests and developing forestry .
they must fully understand that protecting and developing forest resources have important meaning for society . it is a long - term and arduous task . it is also an important duty for party committees and governments at all levels .
party committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously implement the system in which leading cadres at all levels are responsible for attaining given objectives for protecting and developing forest resources when they are in their posts .
we must further strengthen publicity of this cause .
we must help civilians foster their own sense of responsibility . we must mobilize the whole society to participate in a positive way in the campaign for the public good of protecting forest resources and improving the natural environment . we must further strengthen our law enforcement .
the forest law is an important law to protect forest resources .
when protecting forest resources , we must persist in managing forests according to law .
i now focus on explaining the following three points .
it will improve china 's international trade environment and benefit foreign trade in agricultural products .
in the 21st century , the scope of international trade will be mainly formulated by a variety of multilateral trade structures , with the wto as the main player .
a good international trade environment will benefit our imports of the agricultural products that we need and also help us to expand our exports of agricultural products which are relative strong points for us .
so long as we further improve the variety structure and optimize quality , these agricultural products will enjoy advantages in both quality and price , and we can further expand our exports and take a bigger share of the international market .
it will help us in importing new varieties and new technology for restructuring agriculture and grain , modernizing china 's agriculture and grain industry is a systems project that includes innovation in industrial system , changes in operational methods , and optimization of market structure and resource allocation .
before the reform and opening up , china 's agricultural and grain plate was basically " confined " in a self - enclosed circle , and its development was seriously constrained .
since the launch of reform and opening up , exchanges of variety and technology with foreign countries have become a booster for speeding up the development of china 's agriculture and grain production .
we can believe that by seizing the opportunities of wto accession , china is bound to further expand its imports of new agricultural and grain technology and varieties , which will effectively promote the restructuring of our agriculture and grain .
it will promote reforms in the agricultural and grain production operational mechanism and help us to come into line with the international market .
the wto is an open and free international trading organization based on market economy .
after china joins the wto , acting in accordance with the wto trade rules , policies , and principles will effectively spur the further deepening of the reforms of our agricultural and grain operational mechanism .
the challenges cannot be neglected while objectively viewing the multifaceted opportunities brought to our agricultural and grain production operations by joining the wto , we must also soberly realize that joining the wto will also mean a challenge for these operations .
as far as grain trade is concerned , the tariff rate within the quota is 1 to 3 percent , and outside the quota it is 66 to 80 percent .
joining the wto will increase permitted entry into the quota market , and this means that market competition will intensify , and grain , cotton , beans , and other products that have lost their competitive advantage will be challenged to a certain degree .
the challenge to the agricultural products market .
china has reaped bumper harvests year after year since the mid-1990's , and grain and other main products have changed from constraint by resources to dual constraint by market and resources ; a situation of phased and structural excess of supply over demand has emerged .
apart from that , prior to the 1990's , the prices of china 's grain and cotton were lower than the international market prices , and enjoyed advantage in competition .
in the past 10 years , however , china 's grain production costs have been increasing at an average annual rate of 10 percent , and the prices are now higher than those on the international market .
for instance , southern provinces and regions may import fodder maize from the international market and reduce or abolish their purchases from the main maize - growing areas in the northeast , thus increasing the pressure on the domestic agricultural produce market .
the challenge to agricultural and grain production .
it is very evident that the resource constraints on china 's agriculture and grain can hardly be changed .
we have a large population and little arable land , production is on a small scale , and there is only 1.5 mu per capita ; in some places there is under half a mu per capita . this is a big disadvantage .
and abundant resources and arable land are the advantages of certain countries , where production is on a large scale , production costs are low , and returns are high .
this determines that after joining the wto , many of china 's agricultural products are bound to face the challenge of low - tariff imports .
the challenge to peasant incomes and the employment of labor .
increasing peasant incomes and expanding employment for surplus laborers are currently the top - priority tasks in agricultural and rural economic work at present .
taking a general view , crop cultivation is the main source of income for china 's peasants .
the import of foreign agricultural products will have an impact on the income sources and job opportunities for china 's peasants , who are small - scale producers .
in particular , in north and northeast china , which are the main producing areas of wheat , maize , and soybeans , nonagricultural sectors are relatively weak , so the pressure on peasant incomes and employment will be somewhat greater .
in order to maintain and enhance the peasants ' income level , it is necessary to help and support them in opening up new industries and increasing new sources of wealth .
although wto accession may put pressure on china 's agriculture and grain production , there is nothing to fear .
objectively speaking , the pressure and challenges posed by wto accession are normal .
so long as we convert pressure into motive force , make a positive response , and meet the challenges , we will certainly be able to win sustained development for our agriculture and grain production .
actively reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls step up study , clarify misunderstanding , and establish awareness of the wto .
there are all kinds of misunderstandings in china regarding wto accession .
hence , there is no question of letting go a share of our domestic market in permitting market entry .
again , the view that grain imports will threaten china 's grain security is also groundless .
generally speaking , grain security can only be threatened if a country loses its grain initiative .
according to the conclusions of our government 's white paper on " china 's grain question , " it is safe and practicable for china to maintain 95 percent self - sufficiency in grain .
calculating from the current domestic grain production of 500 million tons , 5 percent grain import is 25 million tons .
supposing that by the end of the buffer period in 2004 the whole amount permitted into the quota market has been imported , the maximum amount imported would be only 21.8 million tons , 3.2 million less than 25 million .
moreover china 's all - round grain production capacity is stable at 500 million tons , and we firmly control the state grain reserves and initiative in grain import and export .
it is therefore unnecessary to worry that wto accession will threaten china 's grain security .
readjust the structure , optimize the quality , and strengthen our competitive advantages .
deepen the reforms , create new systems , and change the form of circulation .
wto accession is not an industrial concept but a concept of setup or organizational system .
to grasp the initiative after wto accession , we must deepen the reforms , and establish a circulation setup and enterprise system suited to the demands of an open and liberalized trade setup and the intensive international market competition .
first , we must further deepen and perfect the reforms of the circulation setup for grain and other main agricultural products .
at the same time , we should organize and build a number of " aircraft carriers " with strength and ability to lead others forward , so as to strengthen our international competitiveness .
second , we should further perfect the foreign trade setup for grain and other main agricultural products .
after wto accession , it will be all the more urgent to establish a highly efficient and flexible agricultural produce foreign trade system with few links and low costs .
the key points are : take the international market as the guide , the export commodity bases as the prop , the specialized services as the link , and integration of trade , industry , and agriculture as the organizational and operational form .
formulate an " agricultural produce antidumping law " as soon as possible , so as to preserve domestic market stability .
in order to avoid risks , the wto has formulated a set of risk prevention mechanisms that include the fields of goods trade and services trade .
for instance , wto member - states can take antidumping measures in accordance with antidumping and antisubsidy accords .
by referring to foreign methods , china should formulate an " agricultural produce antidumping law " as soon as possible as a precaution against lawless foreign speculators and in order to effectively protect our domestic market stability .
this is a major policy decision made by our party after considering the overall interests of the country in the face of the new century .
therefore , no matter whether viewed from an economic or a political angle , this is an event of both great immediate importance and profound historic significance .
we should devote major attention to boosting the development of water conservancy , communications and transportation , telecommunications , and broadcasting and television services ; and see to it that the issue of ensuring a rational exploration and an effective utilization of water resources can given a prominent position .
we should uphold the strategy of invigorating the country through science and education , and work hard to enhance the scientific and technological level of the western development .
we should take active steps to introduce advanced technologies from other parts of the country and the world , and accelerate the spread and application of scientific and technological advances .
we should give priority to the development of education ; particularly , we should make nine - year compulsory education universal and wipe out illiteracy among young and middle - aged people .
we should adopt effective policies and measures to improve the cultivation , introduction , and utilization of able personnel ; and work hard to give shape to a system and a policy environment under which able personnel are able to show their ability .
to promote the large - scale development of the western region , we should gear ourselves to changes in the country 's economic structure and its economic growth pattern , adopt a new way of thinking , explore new methods , and build up new mechanisms .
through our unremitting efforts , we aim to build up a new western region with beautiful mountains and rivers where the economy is flourishing , the society is undergoing constant progress , and people of different nationalities are united as one .
therefore , the opening of this column is an event of extremely great significance ; and the column is expected to play a major role in seeking unity of thinking , enhancing understanding , implementing central policy decisions , and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all sides .
the construction of rural grassroots party organizations is long - term basic task . in the new period of the development of agriculture and the rural economy , we can only strengthen this work and cannot weaken it .
so we must continuously and truly improve the general level of the construction of rural grassroots party organizations .
this is both an objective requirement for solidifying the party 's ruling position in rural areas and the heartfelt wishes of the broad masses of rural people .
however , some areas sometimes work hard in this field and sometimes slacken in this work .
this shortsighted activity in the work of constructing rural grassroots party organizations must be corrected as soon as possible .
each level of the party organization must focus on and do their own work well . to improve the general level of the construction of rural grassroots party organizations , we must strengthen supervision , urgency and checks . we must focus on supervision , urgency and checks consistently .
we must not only attach importance to the consciousness of party committees in all areas in focusing on their own party construction , but also rely on party committees in all areas in supervising , urging and checking lower - level party committees .
they must go deep into townships and villages and directly listen to the opinions of grassroots cadres and masses . they must obtain firsthand information , help grassroots people solve their problems and promote the development of their work .
to improve the general level of the construction of rural grassroots party organizations , we must be good at studying new situations , solving new problems and summing up new experiences .
it is through unceasingly solving new problems that the work of constructing rural grassroots party organizations advances . it is through unceasingly summing up new experiences that leaders levels improve .
in its recent comments on the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " published by china , the us state department said it expressed concern over china 's threat to taiwan in its white paper .
zhu bangzao commented on this and pointed out that taiwan is an inalienable part of china 's territory and the taiwan issue is purely china 's internal affair , which no foreign country has the right to interfere in .
all this has fed the swollen arrogance of lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] and the taiwan independence forces of splitting up the motherland , and is an important root cause of tension in the situation of the taiwan strait .
thus , one important topic of discussion during the upcoming sessions of the national people 's congress [ npc ] and the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] national committee will be the motherland 's reunification .
at the end of this century , hong kong and macao were returned to the motherland one after another within the " one country , two systems " framework .
this has prompted chinese people at home and abroad , who yearn for reunification , to turn their attention to taiwan .
president jiang zemin pointed out at the new year reception of the cppcc national committee that the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland indicated that the country had made important headway in achieving the motherland 's complete reunification .
premier zhu rongji also expressed the same view at a spring festival get - together .
vice premier qian qichen declared at the recent forum to mark the fifth anniversary of the publication of jiang zemin 's eight - point proposal that the process of accomplishing the motherland 's complete reunification by addressing the taiwan issue had entered a new stage .
all this shows that , after the hong kong and macao issues have been successfully settled , the mainland will tighten its efforts and focus its attention on settling the taiwan issue so as to accomplish the great cause of national reunification as early as possible .
meanwhile , the changes in taiwan 's political situation have also made the settlement of the taiwan issue more urgent .
while the two sides of the strait are still in a state of hostility since the taiwan issue appeared several decades ago , the two sides do agree on one fundamental issue , namely there is but one china and taiwan is part of chinese territory .
in the 1980's , the situation in the taiwan strait began to ease , the two sides were not as estranged as before , and personnel contacts and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides also began to develop rapidly .
in recent years , however , what used to be covert secessionist activities of " taiwan independence " advocates have become increasing more overt and rampant .
what is even more worrisome is the fact that certain leaders of the taiwan authorities have brazenly gone against the one china principle step by step .
taiwan 's rampant secessionist forces have compelled the mainland to regard fighting secession and " taiwan independence " as an important political struggle .
because of this , qian qichen warned in no uncertain term that " taiwan independence " can only mean war - - and absolutely not peace - - between the two sides .
as the " presidential campaign " is currently going on in taiwan , people are particularly concerned with the development of taiwan 's political situation .
the media have come to notice that the third " if " is unprecedented and its meaning is clear and specific . it states in no uncertain term that the chinese government will not allow the taiwan issue to remain unresolved indefinitely .
now significant changes have taken place in taiwan and cross - strait relations during the past year . more than ever before people are following closely the motherland 's reunification process , which is now at a crucial period .
the taiwan issue has become a national topic of discussion .
this conclusion was based on calculations from the data for grain production costs from 1984 to 1994 .
recently we had another detailed look at the data on china 's grain production costs and made a further analysis of these costs over a 20 - year period .
the data on surveying china 's grain production costs was investigated by seven units working together , including the state planning commission , and it was finally collated and summed up by that commission ; twenty-five whole years have passed from 1975 to now .
the data cited in this article all comes from the " compilation of national data on agricultural costs and returns , " except where otherwise indicated .
when analyzing the changes in grain production costs during the 20 years of rural reforms , we have taken 1978 as the base year and 1997 as the comparison year .
in china , the main grain crops are rice , wheat , maize , millet , sorghum , and soybeans ; rice , wheat , and maize account for over 86 percent of the country 's grain production .
however , limited by the fact that there was no earlier collection of data for these three grain crops , we could only analyze the situation for the six crops over 20 years .
when analyzing the grain production costs over 20 years , if we use the relevant figure for production costs per mu , its comparability is affected by the increase in the per - mu yield .
if however we use the figure for production costs per 50 kg of grain , we can more accurately reflect the real trends of change over many years .
in analyzing the percentage comparisons for the items that make up the production costs , we have directly used the relevant per - mu figures .
apart from that , the production costs are given in present - day prices , and we will correspondingly analyze the affect on production costs of changes in the price index .
the people 's commune system was still in effect in 1978 . the investigation was carried out on 273,264 mu of grain in 1,978 production teams ; in 1997 it was carried out on 191,219 mu of grain farmed by 10,592 households in 1,652 counties .
the grain production costs in china are mainly divided into three main parts , namely material expenditure , the cost of labor , and tax .
in 1978 the tax - inclusive production cost of 50 kg of grain was 11.14 yuan , and in 1997 it was 51.93 yuan , from which we reached the figure of an annual rise of 8.44 percent over the 19 years .
in 1978 the average state price for procuring 50 kg of grain was 11.28 yuan , and in 1997 the average sale price was 68.56 yuan , having increased by 9.96 percent a year over the 19 years .
comparing the percentage increases in the tax - inclusive production cost of grain and the selling price of grain , the latter was higher by about 1.15 percentage points .
the lowest rate was 23.21 percent in 1981 , and the highest was 98.67 percent in 1994 .
in the statistical analysis , the average figures may cover quite big fluctuations .
hence , it is necessary to carefully analyze the actual data for the tax - inclusive grain production costs and average selling prices for each year , and the changes in them ( the relevant material is in attached tables 1 and 2 ) [ tables not displayed ] .
hence , it can be said that the rise of grain production costs has the nature of a trend .
the annual 8.44 percent increase in grain production costs occurred in the course of the switch from planned to market economy in china .
under the planned economy system , during the 13 years from 1965 to 1978 , grain production costs rose by only 1.19 percent a year .
the cost of producing 50 kg of grain in 1965 was 9.55 yuan , but the state list price was only 9.66 yuan , and the net return on 50 kg of grain was thus only 0.11 yuan .
the net return rate on production costs was only 1.15 percent .
the cost of labor at the time was 0.8 yuan .
under the guideline of " taking grain as the key link , " how could the peasants be anything but poor , given this level of returns , since their income mainly depended on grain production !
after the rural reforms , the peasants gained operational decision - making powers , and changes gradually occurred in grain production costs .
table 1 shows the composition of and changes in grain production costs in 1978 and 1997 .
again , 2.8 draft animal work units [ xu gong , 3964 1562 ] were required per mu in 1978 , but only 1.16 in 1997 , the latter being 41.43 percent of the former .
as for labor units [ yong gong liang , 3938 1562 6852 ] per mu , the figure dropped from 28.6 in 1978 to 13.5 in 1997 , a decline of 52.8 percent .
labor costs only rose during the period because the cost of a working day rose from 0.8 yuan to 10 yuan .
items of material expenditure which rose rather rapidly were agricultural chemicals , machine operations , and drainage and irrigation ( see table 2 ) .
expenditure on drainage and irrigation has a dual substitution role in both land and labor ; in 1978 it accounted for 3.86 percent and in 1997 , 6.97 percent .
in advanced american and european countries where there is a lot of arable land per capita , labor - substitute technology accounts for the main proportion of grain production costs ; in this respect , china cannot be compared with them in the structure of grain production costs .
in east asia , taiwan province has the conditions that are the closest to ours ; relevant research data shows that the main cross - strait differences in the structure of paddy production costs in 1990 were as follows : 1 .
labor expenditure in taiwan is only nearly one - third of total production costs ; the rest is material expenditure ; whereas on the mainland material and labor expenditure each account for half the total .
taiwan uses two labor units per mu , while the mainland uses about 20 . 2 .
in taiwan expenditure on mechanized operations is as high as 40 percent of the total , while expenditure on draft animal operations is only 0.8 percent ; on the mainland expenditure on mechanized operations accounts for 2.6 percent and draft animal expenditure for 5.3 percent .
expenditure on fertilizer in taiwan is relatively low , accounting for about 8 percent , whereas on the mainland the proportion exceeds 19 percent . 4 .
under these production cost structures , taiwan 's paddy production costs in 1990 were at least 100 percent higher than the international level , while the mainland 's costs were below that level at the time .
only three or four years later , however , around 1994 , china 's grain production costs , including paddy rice , were higher than the international average , and so far there has been no way of reversing this .
china is the biggest grain producer in the world , and it is also the major grain - producing country with the smallest amount of land per capita ; we should therefore develop land - substitute technology .
in reality , although the cost of land - substitute technology is increasing , it cannot catch up with the increase in the cost of labor - substitute technology .
this shows that the switch of china 's agricultural labor force to non - agricultural work and the development of rural urbanization are slow .
this trend of development has caused the situation today where china 's grain production costs are already higher than the international level even though china 's agriculture is far from achieving modernization .
this has already had a major impact on the process of china 's modernization , and it will play a role in the next one or two decades or even longer .
hence , it is expected that for quite a long time to come , it will be very important to strive to reduce the proportion of labor costs in grain production costs .
agricultural production is different from industrial production , in that there is a low degree of coincidence between the production time and the labor time .
given also the impact of natural disasters , fluctuations in china 's grain production can hardly be avoided ; in particular , since 1984 there has roughly been a three - year small cycle and a six - year large cycle fluctuation .
and the grain procurement price set by the state always stays unchanged for several years , and moreover increases instead of falling in most years .
the marketable rate of china 's grain is generally held to be about 30 percent ; not more than 50 percent of the marketable grain - - that is , 15 percent of total grain output - - is ordered or bought at negotiated prices by the state .
hence , over half the peasants ' surplus grain is sold in the market , and the fluctuations in its price are rather greatly affected by supply - demand relations , and quite a small shortage or surplus will cause quite big fluctuations in market price .
the behavior of peasant households in the face of shortage or surplus plays the role of sending a big signal ; thus the average price at which the peasants sell their grain fluctuates upward or downward around the state procurement prince .
when there is a bumper harvest and ample supplies , even if the state procurement price is set relatively high , under the influence of low market prices , the average actual grain selling price will not be too high .
in the record bumper years of 1990 and 1996 , the average grain selling price fell under this effect ( see attached table 1 ) .
this was because working day costs dropped from 10 yuan in 1997 to 9.6 yuan in 1998 , a drop of 4 percent .
in 1998 the number of working days was the same as in the previous year , and the number of people supported by each agricultural laborer fell slightly from 1.56 to 1.55 compared with 1997 , a small change ( 0.64 percent ) .
the reason for this reduction , as verified by the state planning commission , was that their actual income from grain declined , and not because they reduced their expenditure in expectation of reduced income .
hence , the actual income of the 11,000 grain - growing peasants included in the survey on grain production costs fell in 1998 instead of rising , and this led to a decline in the cost of the working day .
it is worth discussing whether this calculation fully accords with china 's national condition .
the tax - inclusive production costs of grain in china rose by 8.44 percent a year from 1978 to 1997 ; in that case , will the production costs rise by such a great percentage in the next three to five years or longer ?
looking at the situation over the past 20 years , the changes in grain production costs and prices have been quite greatly affected by the speed of economic growth .
the year 2000 may very likely be a turning - point year ; after china joins the world trade organization [ wto ] , it is extremely likely that the speed of our economic development will increase .
summarizing the above analysis , we estimate that there will be a big decline in the rate of increase of grain production costs in the next three to five years .
in order to avoid big fluctuations in grain price , in the future it would be best if the government can readjust the grain procurement price each year in light of the supply - demand and price situation .
after china joins the wto , we must protect the interests of our grain - growing peasants as far as possible , and cannot allow too much foreign grain to hit our domestic market .
for many years japan , south korea , and china 's taiwan province have not shrunk from paying high subsidies to maintain high production costs and prices for grain in order to balance urban and rural income levels , and there is justification in this .
although they use different compositions of technology and key elements , the united states and japan have achieved roughly similar speed in agricultural growth .
this example is indeed very typical .
" there is only one china in the world , taiwan is a part of china , and the one - china principle is the basis and precondition for realizing peaceful reunification .
realizing the motherland 's total reunification is a common wish of all chinese people , including taiwan compatriots , and is where their fundamental interests lie .
the chinese government and people by no means can tolerate ' taiwan independence ' and other splittist plots . "
this was the remark made by li zhaoxing , chinese ambassador to the united states , at a meeting today with more than 60 assistants to us congressmen .
li zhaoxing said : taiwan is an inalienable part of china , and the taiwan issue involves china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and affects the feelings of all chinese people .
under the one - china principle , we are willing to extensively exchange views with all parties , organizations , and people of taiwan who are willing to develop cross - strait relations , in order to create conditions for cross - strait dialogue and talks .
li zhaoxing said : according to the central government 's instructions , the chinese embassy in washington will continue to strengthen contacts with taiwan compatriots , ensure their legitimate interests , and do everything we can to help them solve their difficulties .
li zhaoxing stressed : defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity is a major principle upheld by all sovereign countries .
this is the typical hegemonist logic of confusing right and wrong and calling white black and black white .
the chinese government and people ardently love peace , and " one country , two systems and peaceful reunification " is our basic principle for settling the taiwan issue .
as a matter of fact , supporting " taiwan independence " is provoking chinese people to fight chinese people .
the chinese people and the people of the world can see this very clearly .
li zhaoxing said : the taiwan issue has always been the most sensitive and most important core problem in sino - us relations .
to ensure that sino - us relations develop steadily and are not impaired , the united states should abide by the principles laid down in the three sino - us joint communiques and its relevant commitments - - this is the most basic thing .
beijing , 24 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today that chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan 's four - nation trip to asia and africa was a success .
from 15 to 23 february , foreign minister tang paid an official visit to mauritania , tunisia , kuwait , and iran by invitation .
during the visit , tang jiaxuan held talks with the foreign ministers of the four countries and had separate meetings with the leaders of these countries .
yu shuning held a news conference today on the white paper issued by china on " the one - china principle and the taiwan matter . "
he said the " white paper " was issued within a setting of the taiwan separatist forces intensifying their efforts to block cross - strait reunification , and of some americans meddling more actively in the taiwan matter .
it was certainly not aimed at the taiwan " election , " and was not a military threat .
the only way out for taiwan is for the taiwan authorities to abandon their " two - states theory , " and return to their " one china " stand .
" as to matters involving national sovereignty , there is no room for bargaining . "
yu shuning cited deng xiaoping 's words back then .
and he reemphasized that the " one china " principle is the key to solving the taiwan problem .
the technical negotiations this time began on 21 february and lasted four days .
commenting on the negotiations this time , hans - friedrich beseler , head of the eu delegation and director general of the european commission 's trade directorate , said : " the gap has been narrowed , but we have not yet come together . "
the date for the next negotiations has not yet been fixed .
according to a source close to the negotiations , the two sides mainly have differences on telecommunications , insurance , and agricultural products .
beijing , 24 feb (zxs) - - speaking here today , chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao formally asked the japanese government not to allow the dalai lama into japan .
japan 's tokyo governor shintaro ishihara yesterday said that he would receive and hold talks with the dalai lama in his capacity as governor .
zhu bangzao said that china is very concerned [ shi fen guan zhu 0577 0433 7070 3137 ] about this , and has on many occasions made representations to the japanese government .
he sternly reiterated that the dalai is a political exile who has chronically engaged in separatist activities under the cloak of religion .
china solemnly urges the japanese government to earnestly honor the commitments it has made to the chinese side and refrain from allowing the dalai into the country , so as not to create new obstructions to relations between the two countries .
it has been reported that the united states and the philippines are conducting a joint military exercise in the south china sea .
commenting on this , the spokesman said that china hopes relevant activities could contribute to regional peace and stability .
accompanied by provincial party secretary li dejiang , governor chai songyue , and cppcc provincial committee chairman liu feng on 21-24 february , li ruihuan inspected hangzhou , jiaxing , and other places .
when talking about establishing closer ties between the party and the masses , li ruihuan said : for leading cadres at all levels to heed the opinions of the masses should become regular and institutionalized .
he pointed out : heeding the opinions of the masses on a regularly basis is our fine tradition .
however , nowadays in some places the masses are less consulted and their opinions are less heeded when matters arise .
in a unit or a locality , if there is no sound there to hear or if lying can be found almost everywhere , although this is an issue of social practice , the root cause behind the phenomenon lies with the local leaders .
as far as leading cadres are concerned , politics means uniting more people ; capability means bringing the enthusiasm of the masses into full and rational play ; and authority means making the masses satisfied and happy and enjoying their support .
it is impossible to achieve all these if the opinions of the masses are not heeded .
hu xiaodi pointed out that since mankind started the utilization of outer space , acts of military utilization of outer space have never stopped .
because of the implementation of these plans , space is becoming a test ground for new weapons .
either prospect will annul all efforts in nuclear disarmament and the prevention of proliferation .
realizing the complete reunification of the motherland on the premise of one china accords with the aspirations of all chinese people at home and abroad , and it is the common wish of all members of the democratic parties and the national association of industry and commerce .
the one - china principle is the cornerstone of the chinese government 's policy toward taiwan .
it is best to achieve cross - strait reunification by peaceful means , that is , we should first hold dialogues and consultations .
the mainland of the motherland has expressed its maximum sincerity that any questions can be discussed on the one - china principle .
the publication of the white paper is a great encouragement to all chinese and foreign personages who advocate and support the peaceful reunification of china and a powerful deterrent to all hegemonists , interventionists , and separatists .
the china democratic league fully supports the chinese government 's adherence to the one - china principle and policy .
we should make every possible effort to promote the settlement of the taiwan issue at an early date .
li meng , vice chairman of the central committee of the chinese peasants and workers democratic party , said : the one - china principle is the foundation and prerequisite for cross - strait reunification , which must not be allowed to be undermined .
du yijin , vice chairman of the central committee of the china zhi gong dang , said : the two sides are closer to each other during the ebb tide ; china will become prosperous after its reunification .
promoting and developing cross - strait relations and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland at an early date conform to the will and common aspirations of the people .
li minkuan , vice chairman of the taiwan democratic self - government league , said : cross - strait relations are at a critical moment .
the danger of separating taiwan " legally " from the motherland by the separatist forces in taiwan still exists .
we believe and hope that taiwan compatriots who select the peaceful reunification of the two sides will be able to see through lies , to tell the true from the false , and to make their wise choice .
adhering to the one - china principle accords with the common aspirations of all chinese people on both sides of the strait , and it is in their immediate and long - term interests .
zhu bangzao said : the two issues are not related at all .
resolution of the pntr issue represents the consensus in the agreement reached by china and the united states on china 's accession to the wto ; it conforms with the common interests of the people of china and the united states .
moreover , zhu bangzao pointed out , the issue is also not related to the taiwan issue at all .
the spokesman said : china believes that farsighted members of the us congress will support maintaining pntr with china .
on the issue of choosing a new managing director to the international monetary fund [ imf ] , zhu bangzao expressed the hope that the imf would choose a new managing director as soon as possible , for the sake of normal progress in the organization 's work .
after the talks , long yongtu said : with the two rounds of consultations - - one held in brussels in january and the current one in beijing - - the negotiation stands of the two sides have become very close .
the chinese side is of the view that conditions for holding ministerial - level talks between the two sides have ripened .
shi guangsheng , chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , welcomes eu trade commissioner lamy to visit china to finally conclude the sino - eu talks on china 's wto entry .
jiang zemin arrived in guangzhou on the evening of the day before and immediately went to inspect a unit of the guangzhou military region located in guangzhou city .
but informed sources did not approve of some hong kong newspaper reports saying jiang zemin 's current south china inspection is targeted at taiwan .
jiang zemin stayed at guangzhou 's zhuhai guesthouse , a garden - like guesthouse used by guangdong exclusively to accommodate central leaders . ordinarily , the guesthouse is open to the public , but it had been closed for business since the afternoon of the day before .
armed policemen and public security personnel could be seen guarding along a way several hundred meters long inside the compound .
an attendant at the guesthouse said it will reopen for business on 27 february at the earliest .
in addition , departments concerned have also found proof that he threw away money , like his dirty gambling in las vegas during his trip to the united states .
when he was mayor of shanghai , zhu rongji thought highly of zhu xiaohua , now 51 years old , when he served as vice president of the people 's bank of china shanghai branch in the 1980s .
however , later when the asian financial crisis broke out , the group 's assets greatly declined .
in the new millennium , the chinese people are welcoming the upcoming " two sessions . "
the " two sessions " to be held at the turn of the century are of extreme significance .
prior to the convocation of the " two sessions , " this reporter had interviews with some npc deputies and cppcc members on the topic of economic reform .
the deputies and cppcc members maintained that reform is advancing wider and steadily , great efforts have been made in reform , and achievements are noticeable .
state - owned enterprises carry out reform in a drastic way reform of the state - owned enterprises is the focus of the economic reform , as well as the " key " to the reform program .
the measures taken to reform the state - owned enterprises in 1999 could be called " drastic " measures .
the " debt - equity swap " program draws the attention of the people most .
this is a major measure that the state applies to reduce the debts of key state - owned enterprises .
heavy debts are key factors preventing state - owned enterprises from making profits . some enterprises , though with good products and management , do not have capital funds and cannot run well due to their heavy burdens .
the " debt - equity swap " policy , since its stipulation in the second half of 1999 , has acquired active response from the state - owned large and medium - sized enterprises .
for instance , some large key enterprises , such as anshan iron and steel company , benxi iron and steel company , china faw group corporation , and china second motor company , have turned nearly several billions of debts or nearly 10 billion yuan of debts into shares .
at present , state departments concerned have recommended , through examinations , 601 enterprises to carry out the " debt - equity swap " program and expect to help them turn 459.6 billion yuan of debts into shares .
enterprises expanded step by step the dynamics of merger and bankruptcy . the state made a decision on enabling some large enterprises to close down and declare bankruptcy .
the state economic and trade commission introduced that more than 70 billion yuan were arranged in the last two years to write off bad debts . after these funds are put in place , 860 ailing large and medium - sized enterprises will be helped to halt deficits .
the year 1999 was one when greatest efforts were exerted to realign and technologically transform state - owned enterprises .
after basically resolving the problems of separating government functions from enterprise management , the two large petroleum groups have materialized the integration of upper - stream products with downstream ones and made their production , supply , and marketing a coordinate process .
non - ferrous metal industries witnessed a slash in deficits after establishing aluminum , rare earth , and copper industrial groups .
four telecommunications industrial groups are under construction .
separating government functions from enterprise management is the key theme of state enterprise reform .
of the 530 enterprises which were divorced from the central party and government organizations , most have put their settlement plans in place . meanwhile , plans for taking over and handling more than 6,000 such economic enterprises are basically put in place .
some deputies and cppcc members maintained that thanks to the implementation of reform and various measures , a turn has been taken for getting state - owned enterprises out of plight in three years through reform .
the big rise in the profits of state - owned enterprises in 1999 was the major indicator for such a change .
such achievements laid a foundation for the final realization of the goal of getting state - owned enterprises out of plight in 2000 .
however , state - owned enterprises should further conduct strategic realignment and reform their systems and structures .
wu jinglian , standing committee member of the cppcc national committee , set forth that system reform is the most important task ahead of state - owned enterprises .
from now on , state - owned enterprises should conscientiously implement the spirit of the 15th national party congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15th cpc central committee , strategically readjust their structures , and carry out the modern enterprise system in real terms .
setting up the social security system and giving housing subsidies affect the people 's feelings the setup of the social security system is an auxiliary reform , as well as a basic reform .
at present , there are more than 11 million laid - off workers from state - owned enterprises and over 27 million retirees nationwide .
last year , basic living expenses were distributed to over 90 percent of the laid - off workers , and the majority of the localities ensured to pay 98 percent of the old - age pensions in full and on schedule .
in july last year , the central authorities made a decision on raising the salaries of the urbanites with low - and medium - level incomes , thus making 80 million people nationwide enjoy this treatment .
all these resulted from our country 's ceaseless efforts to improve the social security system .
the housing reform has constantly been a hot - debated issue affecting the people 's feelings .
last year , a breakthrough was made in this reform with the overall payment of housing subsidies as the major indicator .
there were four major indicators for speeding up the reform of the house distribution system .
first , the central organizations stationed in beijing , which found it more difficult than any other areas nationwide in reforming the housing system , made greater headway in this reform .
in august last year , the general offices of the cpc central committee and the state council forwarded and implemented the " plan for further intensifying the housing reform among the central and state organs stationed in beijing . "
from then on , beijing began implementing the system of giving house subsidies on the premise that the " old method is still effective for old people and the new system is carried out among the new persons . "
third , the pace of selling public houses was accelerated .
most areas across the country canceled the method of selling houses at standard prices , began selling houses at cost prices , and also set up a mechanism for readjusting cost prices for houses year by year .
fourth , more efforts were made to readjust house rents .
beijing has worked out methods for readjusting house rent rates and giving house rent subsidies . after the central and state organs and beijing municipality readjust their house rent rates , the spending on house rents will account for about 10 percent of the household 's incomes .
ye rutang , deputy to the npc and vice minister of construction , said that the replacement of house distribution by payment of house subsidies and the opening of second - class house markets accord with the will of the people and the general trend .
the new system will be able to greatly help check the corrosive phenomena arising in the distribution of houses , improve the people 's living conditions , and facilitate the development of the building industry , which is a pillar industry of the national economy .
the financial , taxation , and banking reform advance steadily last year , the reform work in the financial , taxation , and banking sectors advanced steadily .
the state worked out several measures for reforming the financial , taxation , and banking sectors . the people in the entire society pay great attention to it .
in june last year , the state once again cut banking institutions ' deposit and credit interest rates ; it was the seventh time to cut interest rates after 1996 .
in november , the state began collecting income taxes on individual deposit interests with a tax rate of 20 percent .
last year , the central bank canceled the regional restrictions on the operating branches of foreign - funded banks , thus expanding foreign - funded banks ' renminbi business scale .
from 1 october , the central bank canceled the restrictions on supplying foreign exchange only once a year for residents ' private tours to foreign countries .
therefore , the residents are able to apply for use of foreign exchange whenever they are going to leave the country .
these policies have widely been received .
on the threshold of the new century , we should be more deeply aware of the fact that reform is the motivation of development .
the gigantic achievements we made in 1999 were closely related to the in - depth reform .
the year 2000 is the last year , as well as the decisive year to materialize the goal of halting the deficits of state - owned enterprises in three years , which was defined by the party central committee .
editor 's note : as a member of the chinese delegation , liu yuzhu , deputy director of the market department of the ministry of culture , has on many occasions participated in the negotiations on china 's accession to the wto .
now we specially invite him [ as published , presumably her ] to express his ( ? ) personal views on the challenges and opportunities that china 's cultural industry will be faced with after the wto entry and offer them to the readers .
the challenges are self - evident the challenge to the management modes and methods of the government . without doubt , the relaxation of market access will draw in a large amount of foreign capital and private funds , and the scope involved will be even wider and larger .
if the government manages and guides them properly , they will bring considerable benefits to the vast number of cultural consumers , to the investors engaged in cultural production and operation activities , and to the country 's economic construction .
otherwise , they will also bring great chaos to the cultural markets .
the social system and ideology of the united states and other western countries are different from ours , and there is a great disparity in the cultural understanding and management between them and ourselves .
the management means and methods adopted by the chinese government differ a great deal from those of the western countries , which also clash with the wto 's rules .
the negative impacts on china 's fine national culture .
there will be a rising trend and demand for foreign cultural programs in domestic markets not only in quantity but also in quality , as more cultural consumers will have a weakness for them .
the pressure on the existence of china 's cultural production units .
the western developed countries have the advantages in terms of experience , technology , and funds in their cultural industries , and also an intimate knowledge of market rules and operational modes .
given our advantages of possessing cultural resources and being the host country , it is rather difficult for our cultural production units to change the inferior position to superior position , and continue to grow and expand to be still more superior in the short term .
the opportunities exist objectively the benefits of helping people to once again realize the nature , functions , and effect of the cultural industry and cultural markets , and promoting the change of their concepts and the emancipation of their minds .
judging from the functions of the cultural markets , they are both commodity markets and service markets , because they have tangible products and intangible service as objects of transactions .
the acceleration of the process of cultural institutional building . in china , the management of cultural undertakings mainly depends on policy appeals and administrative measures , and lacks legal means to guide and protect the smooth progress of cultural building and cultural activities .
now that we have reached a consensus on administering culture in accordance with law , the macro environment for legislation and law enforcement has been greatly improved . moreover , in order to meet the requirements of the wto rules , the cultural institutional building will move forward considerably .
the contributions to readjusting the cultural industrial policies .
the chinese government , the white paper pointed out , will continue to do its utmost to seek peaceful unification .
the possession of taiwan , a strategically important maritime location , is critical to china 's national security .
in history , taiwan was occupied by spain , holland , and japan , respectively , and was later also used by the united states as an " unsinkable aircraft carrier . "
as irrefutable facts have told us , lagging behind entails suffering beatings , and division entails being bullied .
every time there was a breakup of china 's territory in a context of incessant warfare , china would be invaded by foreign forces ; meanwhile , several episodes of thriving development in the history of the chinese nation have all been achieved under the precondition of national unification .
a failure for taiwan to return to the embrace of the motherland will provide an exploitable opportunity for foreign intervention , a situation which will seriously threaten taiwan 's security and harm the interest of all the people of china , including taiwan compatriots .
this is one of the fundamental reasons why the government of the motherland has refused to commit itself to renouncing the use of force , while persisting in using the principles of " peaceful unification and one country , two systems " for resolving the question of taiwan .
only by returning to the embrace of the motherland at an early date will taiwan be able to have the most reliable guarantee for its security .
by committing itself to renouncing the use of force , the chinese government will no longer be able to suppress and deter attempts by " taiwan independent " forces and foreign anti - china forces to break up china .
taiwan 's military is the taiwan authorities ' important pillar and tool for maintaining the rule of the taiwan authorities .
to achieve their evil goal of " taiwan independence , " the taiwan authorities have adopted various measures to enhance the construction of taiwan 's military .
particularly , in recent years , the taiwan authorities have even more diligently pursued the construction of taiwan 's military , working vigorously to expand their armed forces and to prepare for war and acting militaristically in a big way , in an attempt to militarily resist unification .
the purpose of these military activities carried out by the taiwan authorities has been to militarily resist the mainland , peace , and unification .
as general secretary jiang zemin pointed out : " the communist party of china and the chinese government are determined to use all means to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
any attempt by foreign or domestic forces to break up china will be doomed to failure . "
returning entails a good outcome , while breaking away entails a bad outcome ; the right choice is self - evident .
hopefully , li denghui and the taiwan authorities will think through the matter , and do not become criminals condemned by the history of the chinese nation .
the fundamental reason has been that " taiwan independence " is contrary to the wishes and fundamental interest of the people of taiwan and enjoys no popular support .
in terms of action , li has been indulgent toward and supported splittist forces advocating " taiwan independence " and their activities , resulting in the rapid development of " taiwan independence " forces and the spread of the ideological current of " taiwan independence . "
under the direction of li denghui , the taiwan authorities have adopted a series of actual splittist steps .
for instance , the so - called " constitutional reform " is aimed at transforming taiwan into an " independent political entity . "
by continuing to follow this self - deceptive approach designed to deceive others , li denghui and the taiwan authorities will only end up walking in circles inside the " blind alley , " getting blooded by bumping into walls , and destroying themselves .
the answer should be negative . after the 1960s , taiwan 's economy has developed rather rapidly . nevertheless , taiwan 's economy is a typical externally oriented island economy , with inherent weaknesses .
on the one hand , taiwan is poor in natural resources , and relies mainly on exports for raw materials . on the other hand , its domestic demand market is very small , and its products are highly dependent on overseas markets and technology .
any deterioration of the political and economic environment will bring disastrous consequences to taiwan 's economy .
the announcement of li denghui 's " two - state doctrine " has created a taiwan strait crisis and resulted in popular uneasiness in taiwan , drastic declines in stock prices , and large capital outflows , thereby directly affecting taiwan 's normal economic order and social stability .
this has been the best evidence in this regard .
since the 1980s , economic and trade exchanges between taiwan and the mainland of the motherland have been growing rapidly .
by 1998 the mainland of the motherland had become taiwan 's fourth largest trading partner .
it is proper to say that the abundant resources and huge markets of the mainland of the motherland have provided important conditions for the development of taiwan 's economy .
only by being based on ties to the mainland of the motherland as in the cases of hong kong and macao will it be possible for taiwan to provide favorable guarantees for its economic development .
this is in the fundamental interest of the people on both sides of the strait , including taiwan compatriots .
therefore , the government and people of china firmly upholds the policy of refusing to be committed to renouncing the use of force against taiwan , in an effort to seek an early return of taiwan to the embrace of the motherland .
as for the existing relations of cooperation , the relations of interests shall be considered . he disclosed : the relevant ministries and commissions of the state council are still discussing the policies concerned and have yet to decide on when to introduce the specific policies .
however , some listed companies in hong kong still continued their business talks on investing in the hinterland cable network business at that time , believing that the policy had little to do with them .
the " opinions " standardized the building of cable tv networks and stipulated : in principle , the principal transmission networks , which the departments in charge of radio , movie , and television affairs have not yet decided to build , shall not be built .
wu jichuan , state minister of information industry , the other day disclosed to zhongguo xinwen she that several decrees are still being formulated , including " regulations for managing foreign investment in telecommunication service trade " and " regulations for managing computer networks and information security . "
by the end of 1999 , china had built cable tv transmission networks stretching for nearly 2.5 million km , boasting nearly 100 million clients , and ranking first in the world , with some 14 provinces and cities connecting themselves to a national cable tv network .
the white paper also is a mobilization order , calling on all the chinese people to launch a new round of struggle against separation and " taiwan independence , " and push forward the process of reunification of the motherland .
the white paper is a sharp weapon of the chinese people against " taiwan independence " and foreign interference in china 's internal affairs .
the issuance of the white paper has evoked strong repercussions in the taiwan community and shocked taiwan 's political circles .
public opinion on the island says that the white paper issued in september 1993 theoretically and historically explained that the " one china " principle conformed to reality .
instead of repeating the theoretical and historic sources of " one china , " the current white paper declares the bottom line of the interactive cross - strait relations and the mainland 's determination to reunify china .
the white paper imposes a restriction , urging taiwan to hold a dialogue and talks with the mainland within the framework of one china , and releases a strong message , " there will be no peace without the one china principle across the strait . "
it is aimed at the tricks and means played by li teng - hui and other " taiwan independence " forces that attempt to bypass the forms of " declaring taiwan independence " to attain their objective of realizing " taiwan independence " in reality .
the second point originally was written as " interference by foreign forces . "
now it has been changed to " if taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , " which is more clear and specific , and easy to judge .
the mainland has the absolute right to explain the " three conditions " which totally block the road leading to " taiwan independence . "
in order to evade the white paper , the chen shui - bian camp attempted to lessen the attack of the white paper against chen , saying that the contents of the white paper do not target chen alone .
this is indeed a clumsy denial that has resulted in self - exposure .
at the forum to mark the fifth anniversary of jiang zemin 's 8 - point proposal , vice premier qian qichen warned that " taiwan independence " was tantamount to war across the taiwan straits .
taiwan 's splittist forces should not play with fire that may burn them .
the white paper that expresses china 's determination against separation and to realize reunification clearly targets li teng - hui and chen shui - bian .
as a result , chen shui - bian 's attempt to use a cunning maneuver to slip out will be a futile effort .
" taiwan independence " always has been the " box - office poison " of the democratic progressive party [ dpp ] and chen shui - bian .
li teng - hui 's " two - state theory " has already led the two sides across the strait to the edge of war .
chen shui - bian 's fine words are nothing but tricks to win votes by swindling and to win political power so that he can realize his dream of " taiwan independence . " it is but a strategic application of his means at this special stage .
if chen shui - bian 's dream of " taiwan independence " is realized , he will throw taiwan into catastrophe .
taiwan is faced with a major choice : moving towards separation and war or towards reunification and peace .
taiwan compatriots , who have a glorious tradition of patriotism , are against separation and " taiwan independence . "
for the sake of the fundamental interests of the compatriots across the strait and on the question of right and wrong related to taiwan 's future , it is believed that taiwan compatriots will make a correct choice conducive to reunification of the motherland .
beijing , 24 feb ( ta kung pao ) - - the negotiations between china and the european union (eu) on china 's accession to the world trade organization (wto) have ended this afternoon .
a statement issued by the eu says that progress has been made at the talks and that both parties have narrowed their differences , but they have not been able to reach an agreement .
these prices are higher than the sino - us wto agreement . if china agreed to these prices , it inevitably would have an impact on the wto agreement already reached between china and the united states . for this reason , they are unacceptable to the chinese side .
in the view of experts here , the 15 - member eu has outstripped the united states in terms of gross domestic product and commercial capability .
due to its economic strength , plus the fact that china and the united states have reached an agreement , there is no doubt that the eu will play a decisive role in china 's wto accession .
beijing , 25 feb (zxs) - - from now on , no one working in a state organ has the right to illegally detain any deputy to a people 's congress , and anyone who illegally detains a deputy to a people 's congress will be severely punished .
recently , the supreme people 's procuratorate issued an emergency notice urging procuratorial organs at all levels to make greater efforts to solemnly investigate and mete out punishment in handling criminal cases of illegal detention of deputies to people 's congresses .
for some time , cases of illegal detention of deputies to people 's congresses have constantly occurred and some of them are serious and have made a very bad impression .
beijing , 25 feb ( xinhua ) - - premier zhu rongji met with newly appointed vietnamese foreign minister nguyen dy nien at zhongnanhai this morning .
zhu rongji positively assessed the momentum of development in bilateral relations in recent years .
zhu rongji said he believes that as long as both sides make efforts and adhere to the principle of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation , the task of delimiting a boundary line in the beibu wan assigned by the two general secretaries will certainly be fulfilled within this year .
zhu rongji also expressed his views on trade and economic cooperation between the two countries , and emphasized that china will continue to energetically make efforts to promote mutual - beneficial cooperation between the two sides .
premier zhu rongji asked nguyen dy nien to convey his cordial regards to general secretary le kha phieu , president tran duc luong , and prime minister phan van khai .
over the past year , the npc standing committee examined and deliberated 30 draft laws and adopted 19 of them , fulfilling in the main the annual plan for legislation .
to meet the need of the continuous development of reform , opening up and modernization drive , the npc standing committee timely made revisions on related laws , such as the income tax law , the highway law , the criminal law and the company law .
as a result , those laws have become more suitable to objective reality and can play more active roles in regulating social and economic activities .
lawmakers held that , in the course of examining draft laws last year , investigation and study activities were strengthened and quality of legislative work was stressed .
last year , attention was also paid to ensuring the impartiality of various departments and the work of drafting laws by special committees was further improved .
people of various circles have expressed their opinion that the members of the npc standing committee have attached greater importance to supervision and practical results and have gone down to the grassroots level without pomp .
the standing committees of people 's congresses at various local levels also gave full play to their supervisory roles , had the courage of exploring truth , and gained numerous experiences in supervising individual cases and evaluating and redressing erroneous cases .
the npc standing committee has paid good attention to those experiences .
the incident , which occurred on 25 april last year when " falungong " practitioners illegally gathered around the zhongnanhai , is something that merits special attention .
the phenomenon reflects , to some extent , the deep - seated contraction in the course of reform . it reveals people 's feeling of perplexity and exposes a crisis of belief in china 's society .
therefore , it still is an urgent task to strengthen education on the scientific spirit .
at present , china is in a critical period of its reform drive and economic development .
china has met with many problems and contradictions , which need to be resolved gradually and in a systematic way .
among these problems and contradictions , the most outstanding one is this : the condition of spiritual civilization in our society still cannot meet the need of the drive of reform and opening up as well as the construction of the market economy .
being unable to stand the tests under the new situation , a small number of people have wavered in their ideals , faith , and sense of values .
quite a few corruption cases exposed in recent years show that the rank of those cadres involved in the cases is getting higher , that the amount of values involved is larger , and that the number of collective corruption cases is greater .
objectively speaking , the corruption phenomenon can indeed occur during the transformation period . subjectively speaking , the impact on as well as the change of ideals , faith , and sense of values represents a root of thinking and understanding among cadres about the corruption phenomenon .
in a sense , strengthening the construction of spiritual civilization will greatly help us provide better service to the general cause of reform , development , and stability . it will help us make great efforts to push forward the drive of reform , opening up , and modernization .
this is the reason deputies and representatives to the current " two sessions " show their special concern about the construction of spiritual civilization .
cao yaqin , a falungong practitioner , changed his mind many times but ended up refusing to come to his senses on the question of falungong .
zhang , who had stayed home after being dismissed from his work and encountered economic difficulties , was deeply moved . he pledged of his own accord to completely break away from falungong and return to the correct position on the side of the party and the people .
many prefectures , counties , and units in shanxi province have instituted a system of responsibility at every level for educating and transforming falungong practitioners .
grass - roots organizations in fenxi county instituted a system of responsibility for converting falungong practitioners . the county set up a network for helping and educating falungong practitioners . lin yuping , secretary of the zuoquan county party committee , contracted to help and convert several falungong practitioners .
du litao , a student of the 9752 class of the computer science and engineering department at the taiyuan heavy machinery college , began to practice falungong in 1996 out of curiosity .
thanks to the ideological education by his family and schoolmates , he gradually came to realize the political goals and serious harms of falungong .
after his return to the college , the college party committee continued to educate and help him , insisting on chatting with him once every week .
the leading groups and cadres at the country level should mobilize and organize , in a new mental attitude , the broad masses to make contributions to rebuilding west china into a region with picturesque mountains and rivers through self - reliance and hard struggle .
it is necessary to guide the schools and teachers in carrying out the education on quality through their teaching materials , teaching programs , teaching methods , teaching means , appraisal by examination , and other contents and methods .
the university students , no matter what subjects they are studying , should study dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and foster a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and outlook on value .
they must seriously set right the situation in some places where the students ' burdens of lessons are too heavy and their psychological pressures are too large to be tolerated .
however , it does not on any account mean that they need not study industriously . at any time we should teach the adolescents to make progress through diligence , but of course we must have correct contents and methods .
leading cadres of the party and government at all levels must take education very seriously and strengthen their leadership conscientiously . they should often go to the schools to call on the teachers and students and help resolve their problems .
li lanqing also made important suggestions on how to accelerate the existing educational structural reform and adjustment , enhance the quality of the teachers , achieve a diversified educational structure at multiple levels , and intensify the building of a contingent of teachers .
during his inspection , li lanqing also conducted investigation and study on the work of elderly people , among other things .
comrades in charge of pertinent sections including xu rongkai , zhang zhixin , and zhang baoqing also accompanied li lanqing in his inspection .
a batch of battleships , aircraft , land weapons , precision - guidance missiles , and electronic telecommunications equipment of advanced performance has been successfully developed and used to equip our troops .
meanwhile , breakthroughs have also been made in the project of manned space flight .
our study and research of high technologies has successfully shortened our gap with the world 's advanced level , and has provided both a technological source and a strong driving force for efforts to accelerate the weaponry modernization of our army .
the presentation and distribution ceremony was presided over by li jinai , political commissar of the general weaponry department .
from october 1993 to november 1997 , cai youwei , individually or together with others , embezzled money by hiding income and making false reports of expenditures . he made such offenses five times and embezzled 29,000 yuan .
heshan procuratorate , with conclusive evidence , accused the three also guilty of graft or graft and accepting bribes .
as of 7 january this year , the heshan people 's court has concluded trials and examinations in the cases and also sentenced cao lilin , liu guming , and jiang lianke to set terms of imprisonment .
in accordance with the plan made by the cpc central committee , we should do a good job in conducting the " three stresses " campaign among the leading groups of people 's courts , people 's procuratorates , and public security departments at the county level .
second , more efforts should be made in education and training so as to enhance the overall quality of grassroots judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .
third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .
fourth , we should continue to carry out the " civilization promotion " activities and promote law enforcement with justice .
fifth , we should run the party strictly . we should conscientiously strengthen the construction of grassroots party organizations and bring into full play the model and leading role of party members .
luo gan emphatically said : party committees , governments , as well as judicial , procuratorial , and public security departments at all levels should put the work high on their agenda . they should conscientiously strengthen their leadership .
members of the central commission of political science and law , including xiao yang , han zhubin , jia chunwang , xu yongyao , gao changli , zhou ziyu , and wang shengjun , attended the meeting .
responsible comrades of the supreme people 's court , the supreme people 's procuratorate , the ministry of public security , and the ministry of justice spoke at the meeting . they explained their own systems ' plans for strengthening the construction in this aspect .
how did a large state enterprise with more than 8,000 workers and staff members and an annual total output value as high as over 2 billion yuan get hollowed out ?
this trick of embezzlement was deceptive and puzzling to many people .
when he thought he already possessed the " capital " after having acquired experience and skills and had in hand business connections , chen haiyan tendered his resignation to the xwcgc so as to go it alone . naturally , this was rejected by the xwcgc .
to seek development , chen haiyan suggested to his partners that they return to xiangtan to take advantage of the xwcgc 's human , financial , and material resources to develop and build up the strength of " dayang . "
after that , he exploited the authority in hand to appoint one partner after another as his assistants in the two companies .
also around that time , chen haiyan and others fraudulently obtained business registrations by false capital investment to successively set up in xiangtan and shenzhen phantom companies such as the dayang limited - liability company and dayang industrial company and then contracted for the xiangtan yuhu trading company .
after the case came to light , all these companies were identified by the industrial and commercial administration department as private companies .
these private companies became the tools for them to commit specific offenses and the carriers for them to obtain illegal benefits .
in name , the " dayang company " paid no salary to these so - called " life senior staff members ; " in reality , it deposited their salaries into their special personal accumulation fund accounts .
in the past few years , according to statistics , the instances of diverting public funds from the xwcgc to the " dayang company " alone came to 60 in number , involving as much as over 26 million yuan in total .
in addition , the xwcgc bore the " dayang company 's " loan interest losses totaling over 850,000 yuan .
according to the audit report , this alone caused the xwcgc a huge loss of more than 8 million yuan .
from the days he took a hand in the xwcgc to the days he took control of the xwcgc , chen haiyan set up a total of more than 10 private and partnership companies under the name " dayang . "
to change these companies into " joint - venture " or " cooperative " enterprises overnight , his gang cheated intermediary institutions by providing false financial information and proceeded to obtain business registrations by fraud .
another tactic of chen haiyan 's gang in using " reform " as a pretext for profiting from confusion was to seek honor through fraud and deception by deceiving their superiors and deluding their subordinates .
chen haiyan himself rose overnight to be a committee member of the all - china youth federation and " outstanding entrepreneur . "
draw lessons from bitter experience that stimulates deep thought chen haiyan 's gang did great damage to the xwcgc 's production and operation as well as social stability with their premeditated , organized , planned , and wanton transferring and embezzlement of state - owned assets .
through the voluminous archival materials , the course of decline and bitter lesson of the xwcgc stimulate deep thought .
lesson no. 1 : it is a long - term , arduous task to reform soes .
the key lies in properly building enterprise leading bodies , particularly in concentrating efforts on selecting good heads .
when working with the " taitong company " in shenzhen on the xwcgc 's posting , chen haiyan had privately gotten in touch with the shenzhen dayang electrical works company [ as transmitted ] and taken part in their business activities .
lesson no. 2 : in rehabilitating soes , we must guard against being eager for quick success and instant benefit .
in 1993 , the xwcgc leaders then wanted to introduce foreign capital on the occasion of putting its electromagnetic wire branch factory into full - scale production .
in the absence of in - depth investigation and study , they simply listened to chen haiyan 's sweet talk and blindly believed him and then rashly reached a final decision to close the deal .
in the end , the dewcl lost more than 50 million yuan but the hklc had taken away almost 1.4 million yuan in profit dividends .
facts have proved that we would definitely get a result that is just the opposite of our wish by blindly seeking quick success and instant benefit and acting in a casual , hasty manner .
lesson no. 3 : the strengthening of education and supervision is an important guarantee for making a good job of soe reform .
during his term of office , chen haiyan not only brought the xwcgc chaotic management , unrealistic operation , and out - of - control finances , but also arrogated all powers to himself , assumed an air of self - importance , and acted on his own will .
however , these obvious violations of rules , discipline , and laws were not attended to by anybody and the supervisory institutions and relevant rules and regulations had served practically no purpose .
the xwcgc case has sounded the alarm once again for us .
he emphasized that what is crucial in properly handling the affairs of china lies in our party , in the situation of our party 's ideology , style , organization , and discipline , and in its combat effectiveness and leading level .
in early spring in guangdong , trees are luxuriantly green , flowers are blooming , and vitality greets the eyes everywhere .
this year is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zones in our country .
jiang zemin was very happy to see the economic development , urban construction , and the tremendous changes in the people 's material and cultural life in shenzhen .
jiang zemin pointed out that after carrying out reform and opening up in the past 20 years and more , tremendous achievements have been made in the economic and social development of our country and the people 's living standard has been remarkably improved .
this is extraordinary .
the reason for doing so is to encourage all the people of the country to bravely forge ahead along the correct road of reform , opening up and socialist modernization , and to realize the magnificent goal of the cross - century development of our country .
how to earnestly strengthen party building in the face of the new situation and new tasks is an important issue that general secretary jiang zemin is always concerned and thinking about .
on 22 february , jiang zemin went deep into nanling village of buji town , longgang district , shenzhen city , and had an informal discussion on party building at the grass - roots level with members of the party branch and party - member representatives of the villagers .
on the afternoon of 24 february , jiang zemin held and chaired a forum on party building work in guangzhou city , and explored how to strengthen party building in the new period together with people responsible for the party organizations in some enterprises , establishments , and neighborhoods .
jiang zemin affirmed their achievements in party building work and encouraged them to continue to strengthen party building .
all communists and leading cadres must thoroughly understand and keep firmly in mind these three " represents " and use them to guide our ideology and conduct . only in this way can we really become qualified party members and qualified party leading cadres .
general secretary jiang zemin is much concerned about and has attached great importance to the readjustment of the economic structure and the development of high - tech industries .
during his inspection tour , jiang zemin came to the shenzhen city high - tech industry park , listened to reports on the development of the high - tech industries in shenzhen city , and went to see exhibits of high - tech products .
jiang zemin pointed out that 100 years ago when the 20th century was approaching , important breakthroughs were made in the science and technology progress of the world and they produced an inestimable impact on the development of the world 's productive forces at that time and afterward .
at present , at the door of the 21st century , tremendous historical changes have taken place in china and in the economic and social life of the world compared with 100 years ago .
new and important breakthroughs have again been made in the world 's science and technology , which have opened up broad prospects for the development of the world 's productive forces .
the socialist china of today certainly has the conditions and ability to catch up with the advanced current of the development of the world 's science and technology and to bring about greater development of the chinese nation .
what is crucial is that we must seize the opportunity and do our own work well .
with efforts made over the past 20 years and more since the beginning of reform and opening up , our country has made achievements in economic construction and social development that have attracted worldwide attention and the development of the eastern region has even been more rapid .
the conditions of the eastern region are relatively better and this region should strive to basically realize socialist modernization first and make greater contribution to building socialism with chinese characteristics .
jiang zemin pointed out that to further develop the economy of our country in the 21st century , it is necessary mainly to depend on science and technology renovation and structural renovation .
in this sense , our tasks of promoting reform , opening up and modernization are even more formidable .
it is necessary to step up research and practice on how to increase new advantages in economic development through science and technology renovation and structural renovation under new domestic and foreign conditions .
the eastern region should actively provide funds , technology , personnel , information , ways of management , and other kinds of support for the development of the western region .
the strategy for the general development of the western region will also inevitably provide more opportunities for the development of the eastern region , and the eastern region can make fuller use of the resources and market of the western region to promote its own development .
jiang zemin pointed out that building socialism with chinese characteristics includes the two aspects of developing the material civilization and developing the spiritual civilization , and it is necessary to bring about coordinated development and comprehensive progress of the economy and the society .
since the beginning of reform and opening up , all comrades of the party have done a great deal of work and made remarkable achievements in strengthening the building of the socialist spiritual civilization while persistently taking economic construction as the center .
this should be affirmed .
however , it is necessary to soberly see that making great efforts to strengthen the building of the socialist spiritual civilization remains an important and pressing task before the whole party .
party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly and properly grasp the building of the spiritual civilization while persistently taking economic construction as the center , and continue to obtain excellent results in the building of both the material civilization and the socialist spiritual civilization .
jiang zemin emphasized that education and management , as well as the rule of ethics and the rule of law , must be emphasized at the same time in improving the party 's style and building clean administration .
if education is properly carried out , the rule of ethics is strengthened , and cadres ' ideological and political quality and spiritual realm are uplifted , the occurrence of violations of law and discipline will be effectively guarded against and reduced .
it is necessary to step up ideological and political education for leading cadres at all levels .
with the development of the economy and the improvement in livelihood , leading cadres still have to maintain the fine style of working hard and perseveringly .
leading cadres at all levels must firmly establish and make great efforts to carry forward the work style of working hard and perseveringly , being earnest and down - to - earth , and quietly immersing oneself in hard work .
all leading cadres , especially young cadres , must understand very clearly that cadres and leaders are to work for the interests of the party and the people and must always be ready to sacrifice everything for , or contribute everything to , the party and the people .
all communists , especially leading cadres , must be loyal and devoted , and work hard for the party and the people without being upset by criticism . with such a spirit , one will certainly be able to make achievements in work .
jiang zemin fully affirmed the guangzhou military region for comprehensively strengthening army building and for satisfactorily fulfilling various important tasks assigned by the party central committee and the cmc .
participants in the forum pointed out that the one - china principle is the foundation for the cross - strait peaceful reunification as well as the cornerstone of cross - strait economic and trade development .
yu xiaosong , chairman of the china council for promotion of international trade , indicated that the issuance of this white paper has once again definitely pointed the one - china principle as the foundation for the cross - strait peaceful reunification .
the chinese government and people did not , do not , and will not compromise and change in this issue , nor allow anyone to challenge the one - china principle .
yu xiaosong maintained that along with the smooth return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the cross - strait relations have entered a new stage and face a major opportunity of development while entering the new millennium .
this has showed the chinese government 's stand of adhering to the one - china principle .
he said : the rapid development of the cross - strait economic and trade relations over the past 20 years or so has proven the fact that only based on the one - china principle can we provide a stable foundation for the development of cross - strait relations .
this has been shown by the data of the direct trade transactions between the two sides over the past five years .
the annual import volume under the direct trade between the mainland china and taiwan reached $ 7.02 billion in 1999 , as against $ 1.68 billion in 1994 , registering an average yearly increase of 33.1 percent .
the situation in which the economies of the two sides are mutually benefited and complemented has begun to take shape . " unification is beneficial to both , while separation is harmful to both . "
the achievements in the cross - strait economic and trade exchanges are hard - earned , so does the development of the cross - strait relations .
beijing , 25 feb ( xinhua ) - - chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan held talks here today with vietnamese foreign minister nguyen dy nien .
the two sides exchanged in a deep - going way views on how to further develop the ties between the two countries and reached an extensive common understanding .
tang jiaxuan said : at the beginning of this year , the chinese and vietnamese peoples solemnly celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties .
nguyen dy nien said : vietnam and china are friendly socialist neighbors who are linked by common mountains and rivers .
the peoples of the two countries have showed mutual empathy and support throughout the long - term revolutionary struggle .
the vietnamese communist party , government , and people will never forget the tremendous support and assistance provided by the chinese communist party , government , and people .
the framework for bilateral ties set by general secretary le kha phieu and general secretary jiang zemin at the turn of the century represents a strategic guiding principle for the development of the ties between the two countries .
the " china - vietnam land border treaty " formally signed by the two countries on 30 december 1999 is of great historic significance .
the two sides also extensively exchanged opinions on international and regional issues of common concern .
the supervisory function and power of the people 's congress and its standing committee are an important function and power entrusted by the constitution .
the supervisory system of the people 's congress is an important part of the people 's congress system .
what do the people 's congress and its standing committee supervise ?
in a nutshell , they supervise the enforcement of the constitution and laws and the work of the " government , the people 's procuratorate , and the people 's court . "
based on the content , the supervision includes legal supervision and work supervision .
such legal supervision is mainly meant to supervise behavior in violation of the constitution and laws committed by administrative , judicial , and procuratorial organs and the state organ of power at the next lower level .
guangdong has always been in the forefront among all provinces nationwide regarding the opening up and reform . the economy is brisk , and people 's lives have been improved remarkably in guangdong .
president jiang 's inspection in guangdong will propel guangdong to move up to a new stage in the undertaking of opening up and reform and the building of socialist modernization , and take a bigger step forward on the path of progress .
president jiang emphasized : the key to handling well the affairs in china lies in the communist party , and in the ideology , style , organization , discipline situation , capacity to struggle , and the level of the leadership of the party .
the " three stresses " education is still the core of the main emphases in the work of party building this year , and the party committees at all levels must make conscientious efforts to implement the education .
president jiang called on the cadres to learn and obtain knowledge of economics , technology , law , management and history in order to do a good job .
he urged the cadres to be honest in performing their official duties , work diligently in defiance of difficulties , be upright , work honestly and sincerely , and serve the people wholeheartedly .
this year marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zones in china .
therefore , president jiang 's inspection in shenzhen city is of particularly important significance .
president jiang spoke highly of the economic , urban , and cultural constructions in shenzhen .
the instruction of deng xiaoping says the correct line , principles , and policies regarding the reform and opening up and modernization formulated by our party is the fundamental guarantee for bringing about rapid economic and social development of our country .
president jiang is very interested in and attaches great importance to the adjustment of the economic structure and the development of the industry of high new technology . he inspected some enterprises in shenzhen , and watched the exhibition of products of high new technology .
nowadays , at the dawn of the 21st century , regardless of the look of china , or the economic and social life of the world , there have been great changes of historic significance in comparison with the situation 100 years ago .
the socialist china today is completely qualified and capable of catching up with the advanced trend of the world in the field of science and technology .
shenzhen is currently located at a forefront of the development of the high new technology industry . the important remarks of president jiang will definitely give immeasurable impetus to the development of the industry of high new technology in shenzhen .
president jiang pointed out that it is necessary to intensify the research and implementation of the means to creating new advantages of economic development through technological innovations and innovations of systems under the new conditions in domestic china and overseas .
it is anticipated that under the call of president jiang , shenzhen city will explore more courageously the aspect of developing the industry of high new technology , and make its due contributions to the development of the industry of high new technology in china .
after the chinese government published a white paper on the taiwan issue , there has been a noise from across the great ocean that is against china 's resorting to force against taiwan to accomplish the great cause of reunifying the motherland when it has no other choice .
after the white paper was published , spokesman for the us state department rubin indicated , " we reject the use of force or the threat of force as a way of settling the taiwan issue . "
that this issue has dragged on for a half century and remained unresolved precisely is the result of intervention by foreign forces including the united states .
all this has fed lee teng - hui [ li teng - hui ] and pro - taiwan independence forces ' arrogance of splitting the motherland and constituted a major root of tensions in the taiwan strait .
in the meantime , however , china cannot but get well - prepared for settling the taiwan issue in a non - peaceful way .
to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity is a major principle to which every sovereign state in the world would adhere .
the chinese government and people have all along been uncompromising and lived up to their word on such major issues of principle as defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
it is absolutely impossible for any plots to break up china to succeed .
here is a piece of advice for those in power in the united states : do not underestimate china 's determination and ability to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the us government 's professing of rejection of the use of force or threat of force against taiwan is just like a war monger reciting " peace scriptures . "
the united states has showed off its military prowess around the world and has at every turn used force or threatened to use force , playing the bully and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries .
last year it unleashed violent strikes in kosovo , wantonly and indiscriminately bombing the federal republic of yugoslavia for more than 70 days .
the common people of iraq may become victims of us warplanes practically any day .
with the smooth reversion of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the taiwan issue naturally is placed on the agenda , quickening the pace in reunifying china .
in bringing about reunification of the motherland lie the chinese nation 's overall interests , major principle , and cardinal principles of righteousness .
mr. sun yat - sen [ sun zhongshan ] once said : " unification is the hope for all the people of china .
if we can unify , the whole nation will live in ease and comfort ; if we cannot , the whole nation will live in misery . "
no force on earth can stop the chinese people from accomplishing the great cause of reunifying their motherland and they will surely achieve the magnificent goal of bringing about national reunification .
by adhering to the principle of " persistently building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both , " zhangjiagang city has launched extensively various activities of building the spiritual civilization , and remarkable success has achieved in this regard .
on 24 february , li peng spoke at the meeting on the " three stresses " education held by the leading cadres of zhangjiagang city .
he first explained in an all - round way the necessity , importance , and urgency of the " three stresses " education .
comrade jiang zemin said : " the three stresses on learning , politics , and healthy trends are closely linked and mutually unified , and the core lies in the stress of politics . "
when the broad masses of the cadres evaluate the implementation of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) , they have to look at rectification and reform ultimately .
therefore , it is a must to make great efforts to rectify and reform in an earnest and down - to - earth manner , and transform the ideological enhancement and gains to doing well various practical jobs .
it is necessary to formulate plans and measures of rectification and reform , and make conscientious efforts to implement various measures of rectification and reform .
rectification and reform should not be postponed and conducted at the last stage , instead , it is necessary to closely integrate rectification and reform with the reality of the work , learning while conducting reforms , and rectifying while conducting reforms .
he went deeply into enterprises and rural areas to understand the development situation , and listen to opinions and suggestions .
li peng pointed out : after more than 20 years of engaging in the reform and opening up , various localities throughout the country have made considerable progress of different degrees in terms of the economic level .
this is an issue concerned with by the party central committee and the people throughout the nation , and one of the important topics on the agenda of the upcoming third session of the ninth npc .
li peng focused his inspections on the enterprises of relatively higher level of technology , including yangguang woolen group , shazhou iron and steel plant , xiaotiane company , xijie company , and lianhe automobile and electronic company .
in jiangyang city 's huaxi village , li peng learned about the current economic development situation in this village , and talked cordially with the villagers at their homes .
it has been proved through implementation that it is feasible to accelerate urbanization and the construction of small towns and townships based on different situations , which is an important approach to facilitate the majority of the rural areas to cast off poverty and become fairly well - off .
in addition , it is necessary that we realize that we still direct our energies and attach great importance to the big issues of agriculture , rural areas , and peasants owing to an imbalance in the levels of economic development in china .
it is necessary to continue consolidating agriculture 's place of being the basis , and seize favorable opportunities to accelerate the agricultural structural adjustment by closely centering around the issue of increasing peasants ' revenues .
li peng fully affirmed jiangsu 's achievements made in the recent years in such aspects as water conservancy , communications , other infrastructural constructions , environmental protection , and the building of spiritual civilization .
he encouraged cadres at all levels to be inspired with enthusiasm , guard against arrogance and complacency , keep forging ahead in a pioneering spirit , make concerted efforts , and open up new prospects for various undertakings .
during the inspections , li peng learned about the situation of the meeting of the people 's congress in jiangsu which was in session .
he said : the third session of the ninth npc is a great event of the political life in china at the turn of the century .
if a country 's sovereignty and territorial integrity are infringed upon or carved up , its fate will only be trampled upon at will by others and it will be bullied and humiliated by others .
this was the most heartfelt lesson for the chinese nation in modern history since the opium war .
to the chinese people , the principle of one china must never be challenged because the core of the principle is to maintain the sacred and inviolable state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
jiang dianming pointed out : history has repeatedly proven that the stand of the cpc and the chinese government on adhering to the principle of one china will never change .
during that period , the chinese government repeatedly asked the united nations to change this illegitimate and unreasonable situation and restore the legitimate rights of prc in the united nations .
in recent years , lee teng - hui [ li teng - hui ] has constantly advocated " two chinas " and other fallacies and openly carried out splitting activities .
jiang dianming said : people have noticed that our compatriots in taiwan have intensified their desire for peace , stability and development .
choosing " taiwan independence " means choosing war and undermining the principle of one china and will endanger the prospect of peaceful reunification .
we hope and believe the broad masses of compatriots in taiwan can see through the untruthful lies of politicians , who advocate " taiwan independence , " distinguish between right and wrong , and make their wise choice .
wei jianxing pointed out : the party central committee attaches great importance to making the " three stresses " education a success .
the leading groups and leading cadres at the county ( city ) level are working in the forefront of reform , development and stability and it is their important duty to carry out the party 's line , principles and policies at urban and rural grassroots units .
during his stay in jinzhou city , wei jianxing conducted an investigation and study on the work of improving the party style , building a clean and honest government and combating corruption .
he fully affirmed the achievements made by beining city in promoting openness in village affairs and township ( town ) government affairs .
generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ; and they have made important contributions to the development of the various rural undertakings .
he called on the township ( town ) leading cadres to strictly exercise self - discipline , work diligently for the people , and make new contributions to building a new countryside .
beijing , 26 feb ( xinhua ) - - in answering a question raised by a reporter here today , foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao refuted the accusation on the human rights situation in china made in the 1999 " human rights report " by the us state department .
a reporter asked : recently , the us state department issued the 1999 " human rights report . " do you have any comment on the part about china in the report ?
zhu bangzao answered : the chinese government has consistently respected the universal principles on human rights and actively worked to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedom of the people in line with the national conditions of china .
after long - term and unremitting efforts , the human rights and basic freedom enjoyed by the chinese people have been upgraded to an unprecedented historical level . this is a fact known to all .
there exist serious human rights violations in the united states , yet to date , such a situation of violations has not improved , but continues to deteriorate .
to such an action of the united states , china expresses its strong displeasure and firm opposition [ qiang lie bu man he jian jue fan dui 1730 3525 0008 3341 0735 1017 0414 0646 1417 ] .
it must be pointed out that the united states has , running counter to the historical trend , been bent on lodging once again a draft resolution concerning china at the un conference on human rights in geneva this year . it will inevitably end up in failure again .
we urge the united states to observe the basic principles governing international relations , correct its erroneous doings , and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries by using the so - called human rights issue .
according to the unified arrangements made by the central authorities , hu jintao came to shifang city on 19 february to make a study and investigation of conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level .
on 22 february , hu jintao made a mobilization speech at a meeting on the " three stresses " education of leading cadres in shifang city .
it is necessary to use the experiences of provinces and ministries in carrying out " three stresses " education as reference and to work creatively according to the realities of the city .
when enterprises restructure themselves , they should strengthen their internal management and vigorously develop new products according to market demand ; by so doing , enterprises will be able to strengthen their competitiveness and to be fresh with new vitality .
at lingquan village under shifang city 's yuanshi town , hu jintao enthusiastically heard peasant li shugui 's briefing on how his family had become rich by raising chickens in a scientific way and spurred other people nearby to do the same .
hu jintao said to the cadres on the scene : this proves that when we help peasants enhance their awareness of the market , grasp and apply science and technology , and readjust the agricultural structure , they will be able to get into a position with broad prospects .
at chengdu 's pioneer garden set up by returned personnel who had studied abroad , hu jintao attentively acquainted himself with the situation in which such personnel had started undertakings ; he viewed the achievements on display and asked them what other assistance they still needed from the government .
he stressed once again : economic development cannot be made without science and technology , and new and high - tech industries cannot develop without talented people .
shortly before the end of his inspection , hu jintao heard the work briefings by the sichuan provincial cpc committee and the provincial government and made a speech .
the whole party should fully understand the economic and political as well as the immediate and long - term significance of this policy decision .
in conclusion , hu jintao pointed out : sichuan is now faced with a new situation and new opportunities in development , and leading bodies and leading cadres at various levels are also confronted with new , arduous tasks and rigorous tests .
general secretary jiang zemin stressed : to govern the country , we must first administer the party , and in administering the party , we must do so strictly .
to administer the party strictly , it is necessary , above all , to effectively manage leading bodies and leading cadres .
we should profoundly grasp these remarks and conscientiously carry them out .
during the inspection tour , hu jintao called on leading cadres at or above the division level of the units of the army and the armed people 's force stationed in chengdu .

wu bangguo , member of the political bureau of the cpc committee , vice premier of the state council , and secretary of the cwce , attended and spoke at the meeting .
the party central committee has placed high hopes on the cwce .
zeng qinghong , alternate member of the political bureau , member of the secretariat , and head of the central organization department of the cpc central committee ; and wang zhongyu , state councilor and secretary general of the state council general office , also attended the meeting .
throughout the country , 26 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities have attained better economic results than they did last year .
secondly , the " decision " of the fourth plenary session of the 15th cpc central committee has further unified the thinking of the whole party .
at present , the work of transforming the mechanisms and readjusting the structure of state enterprises has entered its crucial stage .
wu bangguo put forward the following four requirements for the work of strengthening and improving the party 's leadership over state enterprises : (i) we should take further steps to improve the party building in state enterprises .
adhering to the party 's leadership and giving rein to the role played by party organizations in state enterprises as a political core is a major principle which we should uphold without wavering at any time .
party organizations in enterprises are required to conscientiously carry out the party 's basic line , center their work around the production and operation of enterprises , and provide services for the fulfillment of the party 's tasks and for the reform and development of enterprises .
we should constantly improve the work contents and the activity forms of party organizations in enterprises , and explore better ways and methods for giving play to their role as a political core .
we should reinforce the ideological and political work in enterprises , and rely wholeheartedly on the masses of the workers for running well enterprises .
we should carry out an ideological and political education which is directed against the realistic problems of enterprises ; and arouse the enthusiasm of all workers and staff of an enterprise , including its workers , managers , and professional and technical personnel .
(ii) we should further strengthen the building of leading bodies in enterprises .
when selecting and promoting enterprise leaders , we must adhere to the party 's criteria for cadre , select and promote those cadres who have both ability and political integrity , uphold democratic centralism , and always stick to the mass line .
we should attach great importance to bringing up and promoting young cadres , and have the courage to entrust them with some heavy work of crucial importance , so that they can temper themselves and improve their work ability in practice .
(iii) we should carry out the anti - corruption struggle in depth , further reinforcing the building of a sound party work style and a clean administration in state enterprises , and increase the intensity of investigation and prosecution of major and serious cases .
the building of a sound party work style and a clean administration in state enterprises should be closely combined with the work of investigating and handling major and serious cases , and should run through all management systems of an enterprise .
we should eradicate the conditions and the soil that breed and spread corruption , and guard against and eliminate corruption from its root .
(iv) we should perfect the supervision mechanism of state enterprises .
strengthening the effective supervision of state enterprises and ensuring that the value of state assets is preserved and increased is a major content of the establishment of a modern enterprise system , and also a realistic issue that we are facing today .
the board of supervisors is responsible for supervising the financial and management activities of an enterprise , so as to guard state assets and their rights and interests from being infringed upon .
the present year is the final year for the fulfillment of the three - year target for the reform and the difficulty - relief work of state enterprises , stressed wu bangguo .
the fulfillment of this target is the essential among essentials in this year 's economic work .
the key state enterprises directly under the control of the central authorities are the vanguards of state enterprises , and a major pillar of the state economy .
this is not just an economic issue , but a major political issue as well .
firstly , enterprises should strive for new increases in their economic efficiency this year ; and see to it that their profit growth can synchronize with , and can stand at a higher level than , the growth in their industrial value added .
they should watch the market closely ; keep track of the movements of prices at all times ; conduct a careful analysis of their production and marketing situation , product stocks , and accounts receivable ; and make timely readjustments to their product mix and development concepts .
secondly , we should quicken the pace of structural readjustment and the restructuring of enterprises .
we should center around " products , quality , and efficiency , " increase the intensity of technical transformation , accelerate the development of new products , and use high and new technologies to transform traditional industries .
key state enterprises should take an active part in the large - scale development of the country 's western region , and make due contribution to the development of the western region .
third , we should take active steps to promote the building of a modern enterprise system .
we should , from the high plane of system innovation , find new and effective organizational forms for enterprise in the light of their realistic conditions .
it is important to standardize the policy - making procedure of enterprises , and enhance their level of making scientific policy decisions .
meanwhile , we should introduce a standardized corporate reform through such channels of listing enterprises on the stock market .
we should strengthen the scientific management of enterprises in real terms ; make persistent efforts to run enterprises strictly , and to enhance the inner strength of enterprises ; and pay close attention to the cost control , capital control , and quality control of enterprises .
fourth , we should take earnest steps to ensure the stability of enterprises , and see to a successful fulfillment of the target of " two ensures . "
we should give full rein to the role of grass - roots party branches as a powerful fighting force , and to the exemplary vanguard role of party members .
leading cadres are required to set an example with their own conduct ; and take the initiative to show concern for , and to help resolve , the practical problems that are currently faced by workers living in straitened circumstances and by retired personnel .
the meeting was presided over by cwce deputy secretary zhen silin .
public opinion generally maintained : it stands to reason that the white paper was released prior to taiwan 's general election , which will be held in mid - march this year .
encouraged by the united states , lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] dished up the " two - state theory " in support of " taiwan independence " in a flagrant way and in an attempt to separate taiwan from china forever .
before this white paper was released , there were only two prerequisites for using force toward taiwan as defined in the official document of beijing .
one was " if there is any interference from outside forces " and the other was " if taiwan declares independence . "
only by so doing will it be possible to prevent the " taiwan independence " forces from playing tricks for wanton independence in the future and will it be easier to judge specific events and to decide whether or not forces should be deployed to protect taiwan .
li ruihuan , member of the standing committee of the cpc central committee political bureau and chairman of the cppcc national committee , attended the meeting .
members of the cppcc national committee who had participated in making such proposals numbered 1,756 , accounting for 79.5 percent of the total .
the central committees of eight democratic parties and the all - china association of industry and commerce made 63 proposals , and subcommittees put forward 26 .
as of 20 february 2000 , 3,004 proposals had been handled , and replies given to their respective sponsors , accounting for 96.3 percent of the total number of proposals made .
implemented or planned to be implemented were 2,542 suggestions and proposals , making up 84.6 percent of the total .
in the past year , the cppcc national committee conducted investigations of 43 special topics and come up with 37 reports on such topics , and 27 special suggestions and proposals were submitted to the cpc central committee and the state council , many of which were adopted .
besides , the cultural and historical data committee and the foreign affairs committee have also done a lot of work within the limits of their functions .
chen junsheng , vice chairman of the cppcc national committee , chaired the meeting .
the conference planned activities for " stressing civilization and fostering new practices " this year based on work arrangements made by the central guidance committee on ethical and cultural construction .
under the new situation , it is necessary to conscientiously implement the important instructions of general secretary of jiang zemin , further improve our ideological understanding and work , and unfold the activities thoroughly , solidly and in a sustained way .
the main tasks include beautifying the living environment , maintaining public order , enriching people 's cultural and sports life , disseminating scientific knowledge , promoting community service , and cementing closer interpersonal ties .
liu yunshan emphasized the need to grasp two key points in work . the first task is to develop community services .
the second task is to enliven people 's cultural life .
efforts should be made to extensively launch a rich variety of cultural and sports activities and promotions of scientific knowledge that are convenient to the masses . the people should be guided to make conscious efforts to change their old customs and habits and foster healthy and civilized habits .
liu yunshan emphasized the need to do a good job in building three contingents .
the first is the contingent of community volunteer workers . community volunteer worker centers should be gradually established and perfected . their job is to mobilize the community to take an active part in volunteer activities .
in the building of these contingents , special attention should be paid to bringing into play the role of retired party members , cadres , teachers and workers as well as old labor models in conducting ideological education .
finally , liu yunshan emphatically pointed out : in deeply launching activities of " stressing civilization and fostering new practices , " it is necessary to grasp well the following four issues : first , full reliance on the masses .
second , the proper building of positions .
garrison units should be encouraged to share their cultural and sports grounds and facilities with members of the public while stepping up the building of community facilities .
third , persistence in making joint efforts to grasp problems and exercise management .
the role of relevant functional departments should be brought into full play and the enthusiasm of all quarters should be aroused in order to produce a combined force through their coordination and cooperation .
fourth , increased media publicity .
efforts should be made to promptly report on the progress of activities , introduce advanced experience , and increase the intensity of media supervision .
hu zhenmin , deputy director of the general office of the central guidance committee of spiritual civilization construction , chaired the conference .
the us state department publishes a " human rights report " annually .
it goes without saying that in this wide , wide world , every country has its particular problems and circumstances . if the united states wants to publish a " human rights report , " it should do so about its own domestic conditions .
this hegemonic behavior of posing as the " world 's human rights police " is not only an act of utmost disrespect for human rights but also a serious infringement on other countries ' sovereignty .
regarding these groundless accusations , everyone in hong kong will be able to tell that they are absurd and untrue . undoubtedly , there is a sex industry in hong kong .
the six million people in hong kong will never allow hong kong to become a " smuggling center " or " crime paradise . "
- - in the early spring days of february , all kinds of flowers and trees were showing their beauty and vitality in the southern city of shenzhen .

in front of the zhongxing communications company 's mobile communication stall , general secretary jiang picked up a zhongxing 189 dual - band mobile telephone characterized by autonomous intellectual property rights ; he examined the telephone carefully and inquired about its performance and structure in a detailed manner .
general secretary jiang said : " as the development of mobile telephones is rather rapid , it is necessary to master core technologies such as chip technology as soon as possible . "
arriving at the integrated circuit stall , general secretary jiang picked up a special 0.35 - millimeter integrated circuit chip developed by the company independently , carefully examined the chip , and inquired about its sale and prices on markets at home and abroad in a detailed manner .
president hou weigui of the company said : " the cost of producing a sdh single board on the basis of using the chip developed by ourselves is less than $ 100 , but the cost will reach more than $ 2,000 if an imported chip is used .
by mastering the development and designing of chips , we will be able to cut costs significantly . "
general secretary jiang nodded his head and smiled approvingly .
during the inspection , general secretary jiang paid particular attention to products over which enterprises had autonomous intellectual property rights , showed great concern for the development of core technologies , and endorsed the development of domestic science and technology industries .
this machine of yours , general secretary jiang said very happily , is a robot , and it is wonderful that you have been able to export automated equipment designed by yourselves .
at the huawei technology company , ltd . , base in tian , general secretary jiang excitedly viewed a modernized production line based on equipment characterized by autonomous intellectual property rights .
chairman zeng peiyan of the state planning commission mentioned that our country was now proceeding with the transformation of rural power grids .
general secretary jiang said happily that with new equipment and electricity the rural areas would be able to watch television and use telephone .
after entering into the modern electronic home office demonstration area , general secretary jiang happily invited accompanying provincial and municipal leaders to sit down .
let us enjoy the future home office environment , general secretary jiang said .
kaifa science and technology was established with general secretary jiang 's direct approval .
when it was established in 1985 , the precedent of giving shares for foreign personnel 's invisible assets caused some controversy . eventually , it was established with the personal approval by general secretary jiang , who was then minister of the electronics ministry .
general secretary jiang inspected the company in 1988 and 1994 .
after hearing the report , general secretary jiang approvingly nodded his head to show his appreciation for the company 's rapid development .
the growth of kaifa science and technology illustrated the development of shenzhen 's high - and new - technology industries in microcosm .

you made an investment on the mainland in 1988 , and the development of the past 10 years and more has proven that you were far - sighted , general secretary jiang told the responsible official of the enterprise in an appreciative tone .
he encouraged fushikang to further expand the investment in shenzhen . if there is an investment project and plan , it is necessary to diligently pursue implementation , he said .
but the propaganda department has warned some of these providers for carrying foreign media reports .
the authorities said that it relayed last year some reports from the media in hong kong , taiwan , and overseas .
the reports were reprinted or relayed by more than 10 traditional media outlets and websites in the mainland , thus causing a negative social impacts .
internet chinese hotmail told this newspaper that it has never received from the government 's press administration any documents concerning internet news regulations .
it was learned that the press and publications administration recently published the names of more than 10 publications that had been suspended for deviating public opinion orientation and other reasons .
these publications include magazines of theoretic circle in beijing such as " method " and " strategy and management " [ zhan lue yu guan li 2069 3970 5280 4619 3810 ] .
the world trade organization [ wto ] is the only multilateral trade organization in the world ; at present 134 countries and regions are members .
what in fact are the pros and cons and gains and losses for china in joining the wto ?
how should we gain a correct understanding of the issue ?
how can we reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls ? 1 .
the pros and cons and gains and losses in wto accession joining the wto is an inherent demand of deepening the reforms , expanding our opening up to the world , and building socialist market economy in china , and the demand of our economic development .
there are both pros and cons for china 's economic development in joining the wto as a developing country , but generally speaking , the pros outweigh the cons .
it is beneficial for further expanding exports and bringing in foreign investment .
after joining the wto , china will enjoy the most favored nation treatment of a wto member .
it will benefit the effort to speed up our industrial restructuring and optimization .
industrial restructuring and optimization is an important and urgent task in our economic development .
wto accession will create a favorable international environment for carrying out this strategic task .
it will benefit us in continuing to deepen the reforms of china 's economic setup .
wto rules are in essence an application and development of market economy rules in a worldwide scale .
the goal of reforming our economic setup is to build a socialist market economy setup , and its basic demand is to fully exploit the market competition mechanism .
it will benefit china in participating in drawing up new rules for international trade , preserving china 's legitimate interests , and enhancing our international status .
at the same time , china can also use the mechanism for resolving multilateral disputes to reduce head - on friction and conflict with other countries , and effectively uphold china 's legitimate interests .
it will benefit china in participating in the process of economic globalization .
economic globalization is the inevitable tide of history , and it poses both opportunities and also severe challenges for the developing countries .
in joining the wto , china and the other members must strictly act in accordance with the international rules and mutually open up the markets .
this will benefit china in fully participating in international competition and cooperation and in fully exploiting our relative strong points .
at the same time , joining the wto will also benefit china in engaging in broad cooperation with multinational companies , in importing their funds , technology , and management experience , and in using their sales channels and networks to expand our exports .
wto accession will also benefit the building of china 's own multinational companies which can go abroad to build factories and run enterprises in other countries , and enhance china 's international competitiveness .
of course , in joining the wto , we will both enjoy the legitimate rights and also undertake corresponding obligations , which will inevitably pose a certain degree of pressure and challenge for us .
first of all , further opening up markets will cause certain products , enterprises , and industries to face intense competition .
in opening up our market in the past , china made its own decisions on permitting market entry , reducing tariffs , and abolishing nontariff measures in accordance with the demands of economic development and the process of economic system reforms .
after joining the wto , china must abide by the wto rules on opening up markets , which will put some pressure on the speed and measures of opening up our market .
second , china 's foreign economic cooperation and trade management will be constrained by wto rules to a certain degree .
third , the adjudication in resolving multilateral disputes may have unfavorable consequences for us .
the wto 's multilateral dispute resolution mechanism is a two - edged sword ; the results are beneficial if it is used in our favor , but damaging if it is not .
take a dialectical view of the pros and cons and gains and losses how should we view the pros and cons and gains and losses in china 's wto accession ?
we must look at single industries and the whole of industry ; we must look at the present and also at the long term .
in analyzing the pros and cons and gains and losses of china 's wto accession , we cannot just look at one or a few industries but should focus on our entire economic development .
wto accession , however , will also hit and pressurize some domestic industries to a certain extent , such as grain in agriculture , the automobile industry , and banking and insurance in the service trades ; all these will face competition pressure from the developed countries .
from the angle of industry as a whole , wto accession will bring china 's industry more opportunities than blows , and the majority of our industries will gain more development opportunities .
wto accession is not only of positive significance for economic growth in the short term but will also have a far - reaching impact on economic development in the long term .
viewing the long term , wto accession will have a positive impact on reforming our economic setup , restructuring industry , strengthening our international competitiveness , and enhancing our international status .
we must also take a dialectical view of the pros and cons and gains and losses in joining the wto .
meet the challenges , promote the prose and eliminate the cons wto accession is both an opportunity and a challenge for china , and we must seize the opportunity and meet the challenge .
we must actively promote the two fundamental changes in economic setup and economic growth pattern , promote the reform of building a socialist market economy setup , speed up industrial restructuring , and strive to improve the overall quality of the national economy .
this is an important guarantee for boosting our all - round national strength and international competitiveness , and is also the fundamental way for china to promote the pros and eliminate the cons in participating in a multilateral trade setup and reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls .
we must unify our thinking , take precautions against a rainy day , work hard , and do a good job of making full preparations in all respects .
enhance understanding and unify thinking .
wto accession is a major event in the process of china 's reform , opening up , and modernization , which will have a far - reaching impact on our economic development in the new century .
all levels in the country , especially the cadres at all levels , must fully understand the strategic significance of joining the wto , and be mentally prepared for the pressure and challenges that it may bring .
we must organically integrate joining the wto with building a socialist market economy setup and promoting economic development , and make all - round considerations and unified plans .
take positive measures to hold the initiative in meeting the challenges .
all trades and sectors must study and propose targeted and practical measures in light of the wto demands and our commitments , so as to meet the wto pressure and challenges .
first of all , we must provide rational protection and support for agriculture .
in accordance with the provisions of the wto " accord on agricultural produce , " we should rationally protect our domestic agricultural production and guard against and lighten the blows from agricultural imports .
we should restructure agricultural production , optimize resource allocation , speed up the progress of agricultural science and technology , and increase the proportion of renowned , specialty , high - quality , and rare agricultural produce , to enhance china 's international competitiveness in agricultural produce .
we must speed up the establishment of a complete agricultural produce quality standards setup , perfect the plant and animal disease prevention standards , and strengthen the monitoring and inspection of diseases in china and abroad .
second , we must strive to enhance the international competitiveness of our industrial enterprises .
we should speed up the strategic reorganization of the enterprises , form a rational economic scale , and develop a number of powerful large enterprises and consortia .
we must strengthen management , adopt modern management technique , methods , and measures , and strengthen production cost , fund , and quality controls .
at the same time , we must make rational use of the trade remedial measures permitted by the wto , such as emergency import guarantee measures and antidumping measures , to ensure the healthy and steady development of industries related to china 's economic security and major interests .
third , open up the services market in a measured way .
at the same time , in accordance with chinese law , we must strictly enforce the examination and approval system and strengthen supervision and control of the service trades .
fourth , strengthen the control of cultural products .
at the same time , we must strictly enforce examination and approval of the import of foreign cultural products , to prevent the intrusion of unhealthy culture .
we must vigorously develop cultural undertakings in china , make outstanding national culture prosper , enrich the masses ' spiritual life , act in accordance with economic laws , and enhance the market competitiveness of chinese cultural products .
change concepts and mechanisms .
many of the contents of the wto behavior regulations and its operational mechanisms are new to us , and we can only meet the wto 's demands by changing our concepts and mechanisms .
step up legislation and strictly enforce the law .
governing the country according to law is the basic principle for the party in leading the people to govern the country .
we must ensure that there are laws to follow , that those who violate them are prosecuted , and that laws are strictly enforced , and comprehensively raise the level of law enforcement .
in short , we must be good at using the means of law to uphold our initiative in the process of opening up to the world , and enhance our self - protection and self - development ability .
cultivate specialized talent for the wto , and master the international regulations .
at the same time we must vigorously train domestic enterprise managers , to ensure that they will become familiar with international trade regulations as soon as possible and enhance their ability to develop the international market .
observers here believe that this marks the end of the age of china 's going after agricultural production growth with a view to solving the problem of food and clothing and the beginning of a new phase in the development of a modern rural economy .
observers point out : the essential difference between the readjustment to be made now and that in the past lies in the fact that a market - oriented strategy for the current readjustment has been clearly set forth .
the requirements for the current readjustment are set in the background of a relative surplus of agricultural products and increasing market limitations .
the central problems to be solved are to make the production of farm produce meet market demand , improve the quality and efficiency of the rural economy as a whole , increase peasants ' incomes , and expand domestic demand .
economists believe that since the people no longer worry about the problem of food , china has the conditions for the radical reform of the rural economic structure .
china set the requirements for the development of high - yield , good - quality , and high - efficiency agriculture in the 1990s .
from 1996 to 1999 , china reaped good harvests year after year , with annual grain output remaining at the high level of about 500 million tonnes and the output of cotton and other major agricultural products at the highest levels .
meanwhile , people who generally live a relatively comfortable life are no longer satisfied only with enough to eat and enough to wear , and they now make higher demands on the quality of agricultural products .
because a considerable part of agricultural products are not of good quality , there is scant demand for such products ; it is hard to export them , and their prices have continued to drop ; as a result , peasants ' incomes have increased slowly .
as china 's accession to the world trade organization [ wto ] is approaching , china has for the first time felt the pressure of the international market agriculturally .
in this situation , the chinese government has adjusted its strategy in a timely manner .
to solve the problem of surplus labor in rural areas , the government advocates making vigorous efforts to develop village and town enterprises as well as small cities and towns .
economists believe that this is conducive not only to the diversion of rural surplus labor and an increase in peasants ' incomes but also to bringing about the growth of demand for investment and consumption and promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .
structural readjustment does not imply that china will relax its efforts in grain production .
experts forecast that china 's population will increase to 1.6 billion in the next 30 years and that it will need to increase its grain production by 30 percent if per capital annual consumption of grain is 400 kilograms .
the chinese government is fully aware of this .
therefore , the chinese government has required all localities to do everything possible to maintain their grain - producing ability in order to meet any possible emergency when necessary .
beijing , 28 feb ( xinhua ) - - to rapidly and correctly investigate cases of dereliction of duty , we need the vigorous cooperation and close coordination of all departments concerned .
the signatory units unanimously held that the signing of the " opinions " and their issuance for implementation to the lower level will play a positive role in promptly and correctly investigating and handling cases of dereliction of duty involving state functionaries .
beijing , 28 feb ( beijing ) - - buffeted by rampant smuggling and piracy , the environment for publishers , manufacturers , and distributors of audio - visual products in china has worsened dramatically in recent years .
some producers of audio - visual products can hardly subsist by merely counting on their main business , and markets selling non - pirated audio - visual products are withering .
that was a statement made by minister of culture sun jiazheng at the 14th session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee today [ 28 february ] .
in view of the problems in the chinese markets of cultural goods , the npc standing committee met today to hear a special report prepared by the ministry of culture on the management of the markets of cultural goods .
sun jiazheng said : pirated audio - visual products come primarily from three sources : 1 ) they are smuggled into the country from the outside .
according to estimates , in southeast asia , hong kong , macao and taiwan , there are several hundred underground lines that produce laser discs meant for the mainland markets .
2 ) second , they are produced by the underground producers at home .
3 ) they are products produced by legitimate producers that have succumbed to the onslaught of pirated products and to the temptation of high profits .
sun jiazheng analyzed : the main causes of the chinese markets being replete with pirated audio - visual products are as follows : - - consumers ' growing needs and the inadequate supply of legitimate products have created an enormous capacity for pirated audio - visual products .
- - consumers ' unawareness and feeble concept of the need to protect intellectual property rights .
some consumers buy pirated goods because they are inexpensive . it is hard for them to reject pirated goods voluntarily .
this being the case , it is difficult to create a force that can eliminate pirated audio - visual products from all sides .
- - inefficient management and difficulty in enforcing the law .
with respect to management , it is still multilateral , especially in local areas .
different departments have different policies , which crisscross with each other laterally and vertically . in actual operations , certain illegal elements , harbored by administrators , are not punished . some administrators , under constant retaliation and threat , dare not handle the problem seriously .
he added that mobile and harassing raids on pirated goods should be replaced by law , regulations , and effective mechanisms . 1 .
continuous efforts must be made to ferret out underground laser disc producers , tighten the management of lawful publishers , manufacturers and producers so as to uproot pirated audio - visual products . 2 .
we must energetically compress and consolidate the areas that sell audio - visual products , and strictly crack down on unlicensed stalls and roving sellers .
certain markets of audio - visual products have become distributors of pirated goods .
we must intensify our efforts in controlling audio - visual imports and in cracking down on smuggling activities and trading of smuggled goods . 4 .
we must continue to improve all administrative measures , streamline the administrative system , and tighten day - to - day market controls . 5 .
qiao xiaoyang made the above remarks when delivering a report on the results of deliberations concerning the npc standing committee 's draft resolution on strengthening supervision over the economic work .
the 13th meeting of the ninth npc standing committee conducted a preliminary deliberation concerning the npc standing committee 's draft resolution on strengthening its economic supervision work , which was submitted for examination by the npc financial and economic committee , noted qiao xiaoyang .
qiao xiaoyang indicated : based on the opinions of some members of the npc standing committee , it has been suggested that the title of this decision be amended as follows : " the decision of the npc standing committee on strengthening supervision over economic work . "
according to qiao xiaoyang , stipulations on the examination focuses of draft plans and planning reports are carried in the fifth clause of the draft resolution .
a sound coordination is required as concerns the concrete work arrangements of the supervision .
in view of this need , the npc law committee has also suggested amendments to the relevant clauses of the draft resolution .
at the same time , they stressed the need to have a proper understanding of problems exposed in the customs ranks and to promote clean administration and combat corruption in a deepgoing manner .
zhu rongji 's speech evoked great repercussions throughout society .
in this connection , these reporters interviewed qian guanlin , director of the general administration of customs [ gac ] .
qian guanlin gave us a brief introduction to the development of the customs ranks since the national anti - smuggling work conference in july 1998 .
when asked about plans for building up the customs ranks in the next stage , qian guanlin replied : to guard the passes , we must first put the customs in order ; to put the customs in order , we must be sure to be strict .
the customs departments will comprehensively strengthen the development of the customs ranks by laying stress on the arrangement of three anti - corruption work as determined by the central authorities .
first , to " put the customs under strict administration , " we must start with putting the officials under strict administration and strengthening the administration of and supervision over leading cadres .
second , we will center on the proper handling of our relationship with the objects of our work to conduct deepgoing education and rectification and conscientiously check unhealthy tendencies in the profession .
such malpractices will be strictly dealt with as soon as detected and there shall be absolutely no leeway for " offsetting faults against merits " or " giving the offender a second chance . "
third , we will strictly investigate and deal with cases of coraruption in law enforcement .
anyone found violating the " rules for clean administration by the customs " shall be severely punished in accordance with the maximum penalty .
fourth , we will strengthen and improve ideological and political work in the customs departments by laying stress on grass - roots development .
fifth , we will deepen the reform of customs clearance operations to ensure that customs is administered according to the law and is honest in discharging administrative duties .
the quality of economic operation has further improved .
the volume of losses suffered by loss - making industrial enterprises with a certain operation scale dropped by 15.2 percent .
overall investment in fixed assets has continued to maintain a growth momentum .
in 1999 social investment in fixed assets increased by 5.2 percent from the previous year , of which investment in the state - owned economy and other types of economic sectors was up 6.1 percent .
in foreign trade , the export sector has picked up .
in 1999 , total volume of exports amounted to $ 194.9 billion , up 6.1 percent from the previous or a noticeably better improvement than expected at the beginning of the year .
total volume of imports was $ 165.8 billion , up 18.2 percent or a trade surplus of $ 29.1 billion .
the state 's foreign exchange reserve at yearend was $ 154.7 billion or a gain of $ 9.7 billion from the end of the previous year .
market sales have been stable and increasingly active .
in the first half of 1999 , market sales were relatively dull .
thanks to the state 's efforts to increase the income of medium - and low - income city dwellers and the number of holidays , market sales grew at an accelerated pace quarter by quarter .
total sales volume of social consumer goods throughout the year increased by 6.8 percent from the previous year , of which the increased figure in the last quarter alone was 8 percent .
although the growth rate in 1999 as a whole could not be considered high , the market had begun to show a level of activism in dynamic terms .
education and science have made new progress .
particularly the successful experimental flight of the " shenzhou " spaceship marked that china 's manned spaceflight cause had made an important step .
it was reported that last year various localities generally strengthened the comprehensive management of public security , and the situation of public security throughout the country as a whole was stable .
in 25 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities throughout the country , party and government leaders at various levels came forward to sign letters of responsibility for the comprehensive management of public security .
most of the various localities have defined party and government heads as the first responsible persons in comprehensively managing public security .
the " regulations " consist of 13 chapters with 92 articles .
the " regulations " point out : education programs run by army academies and schools are an important component part of the state 's education undertaking , and the basic means for the training of military professionals .
these " regulations " took effect on the day of promulgation .
the west particularly northwest china is rich in land resources , but plagued by fragile ecological environment such as the scarcity of water resources and worsening and soil erosion problems .
due to unawareness of effective allocation and scientific utilization of water resources , ecological environment was destroyed by good intentions in making wrong things , from which a lesson must be drawn in the development of water resources in western china .
some similar examples can be found in western china .
water conservancy projects in western areas can be classified as engineering projects and non - engineering projects , wang shucheng said .
every province , municipality , and region will be allocated certain projects in line with special emphasis on local condition .
xinjiang will emphasize on project of controlling talimu ( tarim ) river and regional water while qinghai will emphasize on water transfer project to solve the problem of shortage of water supply to xining and neimenggu will mainly solve the issue of reforming water - efficient irrigation .
the two sides had an extensive exchange [ guang fan di jiao huan 1639 3131 0966 0074 2255 ] of views on issues of common concern on international and regional security and bilateral relations .
prior to this , vice adm. shi yunsheng , commander of the navy , met with blair and his delegation .
blair 's delegation arrived in beijing yesterday afternoon for a visit at the invitation of the chinese pla general staff department .
beijing , 28 feb ( xinhua ) - - xiao yang , president of the supreme people 's court , signed letters of responsibility for improving party style and building a clean and honest administration with each and every vice president today .
afterward , the vice presidents signed such responsibility letters with the top leaders of the courts , departments , bureaus , and offices under their jurisdiction .
meanwhile , disciplinary penalties should be imposed on those leaders who seriously practice bureaucracy , who neglect the duty of supervising personnel , and who are directly responsible for poor management .
lax discipline and the failure to make the enforcement of laws known to the public are major enemies affecting the construction of the contingent of cadres . only by so doing will leading cadres not lag behind others and be ever victorious in the course of advancement .
under strict management and strict supervision , we will be able to forcefully carry forward justice , to vigorously check unhealthy trends , and to completely change the mental outlook of the contingent of judges .
- - after reunification , taiwan does not need to be subjected to the cpc 's leadership , and the cpc will not develop its organizations in taiwan .
- - after reunification , the leadership of the country will be formed by representatives of all political parties elected in the mainland and taiwan , and a certain form of coalition government will be formed .
with the publication of the white paper on the taiwan issue , the struggle of the chinese government and people against division and " taiwan independence " has entered a new stage .
the white paper fully shows the sense of urgency and mission china has in resolving the taiwan issue .
to achieve the goal of national reunification in the new century , china must adhere to the strategic thinking of invigorating the armed forces with science and technology , accelerate the modernization of their weapons and equipment , and continuously reinforce its national defense capability .
on no account must china allow the " taiwan independence " forces to do whatever they like on the island .
if the one - china principle is scrapped and taiwan is even separated from china in whatever means and with whatever forms , this will lead the two sides of the strait to the abyss of war .
while attacking " taiwan independence , " china will focus the future military struggle on armed intervention by foreign forces . national reunification is the fundamental demand of a state 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
nevertheless , to contain china , the us hegemonism views taiwan as a " trump card " with which to contain the chinese mainland .
it pursues a so - called " no reunification , no war , and no peace [ bu he 0008 0735 ] " in an attempt to split taiwan from china forever .
this us strategy serves its global strategy designed to control the european and asian continents , prevent the rise of powers that can sit as equals at the same table with the us , and safeguard its global hegemony .
hence , with this hegemonist strategy and desire , the us views the increasingly powerful china as a major hidden strategic opponent .
the us spearheads at china its efforts to strengthen the us - japan military alliance , speed up the deployment of the theatrical missile defense system in east asia , and intensify the " use of taiwan to contain china . "
out of its need to become a political power and military power from an economic power and need to contain china , hiding itself behind the back of the us , japan quietly " allies itself with the us in containing china . "
the actions taken by the us and japan may possibly spark a confrontation between big powers in east asia and will thus endanger peace in the asia - pacific region and the world at large .
the us has also intensified its military infiltration in central asia and south asia in " a selective way . "
against this background , the military factor of the us policy toward taiwan has become more prominent .
after the us department of defense issued a report on military strength in the taiwan strait at the beginning of last year , the us has noticeably increased arms sales to taiwan with a clearer objective in mind and intensified technical upgrades of weapons sold to taiwan .
at the same time , the us congress is now pushing the passage of the " taiwan security enhancement act . " this is a challenge to china 's fundamental national interests and a threat to its national security and national reunification .
the chinese government has never compromised in the slightest degree on the major issue of the principle of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and china means what it says in this regard .
china is not the federal republic of yugoslavia and taiwan is also not kosovo .
the us effort to strength its military ties with taiwan will aggravate the tense situation in cross - strait relations and bring about serious consequences to sino - us relations rather than guaranteeing taiwan 's " security . "
to safeguard national security and achieve the motherland 's reunification , china must speed up the pace of national defense modernization and continuously enhance its military strength .
the purpose for china to strengthen its military strength is for self - defense . this is conducive to peace and stability in the asia - pacific region and peace in the world .
the flowers are blooming in the spring warmth , and all life is renewed . china 's economy has advanced steadily amid the difficulties of recent years .
the economic development goal for 1999 was achieved .
gdp rose by 7.1 percent , which exceeded the expectations at the beginning of the year .
foreign exchange reserves totaled $ 154.7 billion , and tax revenue broke through 1 trillion yuan ; both figures were records .
national people 's congress [ npc ] deputy yao zhenyan said that expanding domestic demand and practicing a positive fiscal policy and corresponding monetary policy have played a key role in these achievements .
this happened to be the year of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the prc and the reversion of macao , and we were also facing imminent entry to the wto , thus further embroiling us in the opportunities and challenges of world economy .
in 1999 china decided to continue to practice a positive fiscal policy and further expand domestic demand .
at that time , the stock market , termed the barometer of the national economy , was sagging .
some deputies pointed out that unless forceful new measures had been adopted , the good momentum of economic rebound since the second half of 1998 would have been hard to sustain .
second , china practiced a positive fiscal policy , avoided a situation in which investment came solely from the government , and paid attention to mobilizing nongovernmental investment and to stimulating consumption .
in 1998 the newly issued state bonds were mainly used in infrastructure construction , but in 1999 some of them were used as discount payments on enterprise technology loans , to encourage the enterprises to update their technology and plant and increase hi - tech input .
according to calculations , 9 billion worth of fiscal discounting can draw forth about 180 billion worth of investment in technical improvements .
some 84 million people benefited from this policy , and it is hoped that residents ' income will increase by over 100 billion yuan a year .
third , in developing the economy , we have persisted in adopting the guideline of expanding domestic demand , and there is no contradiction between this and expanding our opening up to the world and fully exploiting both domestic and foreign markets and resources .
the state continued to do everything possible to increase exports in 1999 .
in april the ministry of finance readjusted the policy regarding tax on imported plant , thus appropriately increasing imports , while in addition the customs cracked down hard on smuggling , with the result that the strategy of spurring exports and market diversification through imports achieved its predicted results .
some of the deputies gave this evaluation : " with no duplicate construction , we have done things that we wanted to do for many years . "
xie ping , a deputy to the ninth npc and director of the research bureau of the people 's bank of china , said that practice has proven that the orientation of the state bond investment set by the central authorities is correct .
the merit is here now , and the benefits will be long term .
there was a decline of 84 percent in relatively big danger spots and 90 percent in dangerous gushers .
he said that the effects of building water conservancy products and taming the river and the lakes are evident .
such a change results from the large - scale project to improve the rural power grids which started in the second half of 1998 .
in 1999 china 's economy tasted to the full the vexations of surplus production , and advanced toward new life amid gradual restructuring and technical improvement .
there was increased production of vegetables , fruit , aquatic products , and oil crops , which were in quite great market demand .
today all - round restructuring of agriculture has become a new starting point for comprehensively raising the peasants ' returns and increasing their income .
the quality of china 's economic growth has gradually improved amid both protection and pressure .
the rate of decline of the price level , which has been in negative growth for more than 20 successive months , has gradually lessened as domestic demand is stimulated , and the categories of commodities whose prices are rising is now increasing .
although the most difficult period for china 's economic operations is now over , we have not shaken off the problem of insufficient demand , and there will still be many problems and obstacles on the way ahead .
in the new millennium , we again welcome the " two sessions . "
in the past year , china has advanced in big strides along the road of building democracy and the legal system .
formulating , amending , and interpreting laws - - legislation more mature , of better quality by the day the formulation of our law on legislation has attracted world attention over the past year .
china has speeded up its legislative work in recent years .
how can we ensure that our formulation of laws is fair and scientific ?
the law on legislation has been listed in the legislative agenda .
following two examinations and discussions by the national people 's congress [ npc } standing committee , the draft of the law on legislation will be submitted to the third session of the ninth npc for examination and discussion .
more than quantity , legislation requires quality .
the legislative measures of the npc standing committee last year gradually tended to become more varied : apart from drawing up new laws , it focused on stepping up amendments and interpretations of laws .
many deputies and committee members said that china 's laws accord better with objective reality and the authority of the law has been better upheld as a result of amending and interpreting the relevant laws at the appropriate time in accordance with the requirements of reform and modernization .
our legislation is becoming more mature by the day .
her request was supported by the state general administration for environmental protection .
ms. yao 's experience has proven one fact : the law must ensure that the administrative organs carry out their duties according to law , and also prevent abuse of administrative powers and protect citizens ' rights and interests .
ms. yao 's appeal has also proven a fact : only by carrying out administration according to law can functions be correctly exercised and can the masses ' support and cooperation be gained .
prior to the law on administrative review , administrative powers were constrained by a series of laws such as the law on administrative procedure , the law on state compensation , and the law on administrative punishment .
this showed yet again the firm attitude and resolute determination of our government in carrying out administration according to law .
speaking of carrying out administration according to law , some deputies and committee members held : " for the government at all levels , administering according to law is the inevitable demand and the best choice . "
intensify supervision , improve supervision methods , perfect supervision procedure - - supervision yields practical results intensifying supervision has consistently been an issue of concern to the masses .
after the second session of the ninth npc , standing committee chairman li peng pointed out : assign supervisory work a position of equal importance with legislative work , further intensify supervision , improve supervision methods , perfect the supervision procedure , and attach importance to practical results .
to formulate a law on supervision has been the common call of deputies and committee members in recent years .
since a very great deal of work and considerable difficulty is involved in tabling a law on supervision all at one go , the npc standing committee has decided to first formulate a number of specific decisions on supervision .
the villagers of bailian village of pandai township of this city were unhappy over the vagueness of the village 's financial accounts , and a meeting of over 600 villagers was held which lawfully dismissed village committee head he guangshou from his post .
it can be said that in the more than one year since the enactment of the organic law on village committees , the exercise of villagers ' self - government according to law has won the support of village peasants throughout the country .
ma xianzhang , a npc deputy and vice chairman of the henan provincial people 's congress , said : " nine hundred million of the 1.2 billion people of china live in the rural areas ; this is china 's basic national condition .
respecting the democratic rights of the peasants to be masters in the house and expanding grassroots democracy is therefore particularly important for building democracy and the legal system in china .
we must attach importance to mobilizing the masses ' initiative and creativity in the process of strengthening the building of grassroots democracy and the legal system . "
we are informed that making village affairs public and democratic management have been implemented throughout the country since last year .
moving out of the shadow of cases involving connections , favors , and cash - - striving to ensure judicial fairness in 1999 , the court system launched an " enforcement year " drive , which effectively eased the difficulties of judgement enforcement .
speaking on this change , national cppcc member wu changzhen said with considerable feeling : " judicial fairness is the soul of judicial work .
when the court makes a judgement , it should be enforced , otherwise , where is the fairness ? "
according to statistics , from january to october last year , courts throughout the country completed the enforcement of judgments in 1.65 million cases , 31 percent more than in the corresponding period of 1998 ; the price tag for those involved was 143.7 billion yuan .
the reporters profoundly felt while interviewing people that judicial fairness remains a hot point of concern to everyone .
the courts and procuratorates throughout the country have adopted the forms of holding forums , report meetings , and so on to listen to the views of deputies and committee members and seriously digest their views and suggestions .
on 15 november 1999 , china and the united states signed a bilateral agreement on china 's entry into wto .
after that , it could be said that china 's negotiations with the major signatory powers were full of twists and turns .
between 1986 and 1989 , china frequently held bilateral consultations with the major signatory powers , including the united states .
after 1989 , as the western countries headed by the united states made unrealistic demands on china , sino - us negotiations on china 's return to gatt hit a standstill .
an analysis by experts here stated that china 's " entry into wto " has quickened since last year and this is the outcome of a strategic decision made by the hierarchy of the chinese government by judging the hour and sizing up the situation .
in this sense , the " win - win " agreement reached between china and the united states last year is of paramount realistic and far - reaching historical significance .
the experts pointed out : as the largest developed country in the world at the moment , the united states wields considerable influence in the global economy and trade and is also china 's second - largest trading partner .
as a major wto signatory power , the united states exerts important influence over the international trade rules ' formulation and operation .
therefore , the bilateral agreement reached between china and the united states has removed the biggest obstacle on the road leading to china 's " entry into wto . "
after china and the united states reached a bilateral agreement , other wto member nations , including the eu , stated that they will speed up negotiations with china and enable china to accede to wto at an earlier date .
as a matter of fact , china 's earlier accession to wto will benefit not just china but also the countries the world over , wto , and the global economic development .
the day china accedes to wto will be a historical event and a great day for china and the world .
faced with her accelerating entry into wto at present , china has started making positive preparations .
some symposiums or study classes on the theme of china 's entry into wto have also been welcomed by the public at large .
an analysis by some experts stated that as the day china accedes to wto is drawing near day by day , the issues concerning " entry into wto " are likely to be major topics of concern for discussion at this year 's forthcoming " two sessions . "
during the era of deng xiaoping and chiang ching - kuo , in particular , cross - strait relations were moving in the direction of relaxed and steady development .
jiang zemin , the leader of the third generation of the chinese government , has all the more spared no effort in pushing forward the great reunification cause of the motherland .
this has been the most relaxed atmosphere and the most sincere benevolence ever offered by the cpc to the kmt , and by mainland compatriots to taiwan compatriots , since the founding of new china .
however , lee teng - hui , head of those in power in taiwan , has acted in a diametrically opposite way , and has gradually taken the separatist road of " taiwan independence . "
if taiwan is invaded and occupied by foreign countries , which is the second scenario pointed out in the white paper , the chinese government must also adopt all drastic measures possible , including the use of force , to settle the taiwan issue .
based on the moral principles of mankind and in line with international law , a country has the power , the responsibility , and the obligation to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to realize its unification .
in this aspect , the chinese people enjoy a glorious tradition and have a sincere love for their own motherland ; and they will never allow themselves to be bullied by foreign invaders , or tolerate the loss of even one inch of the sacred land of their country .
as early as 1950 , with the aim of guarding our home and protecting our people , we carried out the great patriotic and international struggle of resisting us aggression and aiding korea , and successfully defeated us aggressors in the end .
in 1969 , we launched a counterattack against the then vietnam in self - defense , and successfully guarded our frontier .
it is beyond any doubt or reproach that all these were patriotic and just moves aimed at protecting and safeguarding china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
if the taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse a peaceful settlement of cross - strait reunification through negotiations , which is the third scenario pointed out in the white paper , the chinese government will be forced to settle the issue by use of force .
today , by spreading the view that " there is no timetable " for reunification , the taiwan authorities aim to put off the settlement of the issue indefinitely ; and their highlighted effort to " stall for time " has proved an extremely dangerous practice .
going all out for the first choice , putting up with the second choice , and avoiding the last choice is wishful thinking of the taiwan authorities , which will get them nowhere in reality .
adhering to the one - china principle is the basis and prerequisite for cross - strait negotiations .
this year is the run - up to the new century , and this spring is the first spring of the new millennium . their special positions in the coordinate of time make this year 's " two sessions " particularly significant .
in this sense , the upcoming " two sessions " are regular annual sessions , but not regular sessions of a general meaning .
major items on the agenda of the " two sessions " this year 's " two sessions " will have the same characteristic of a short duration as last year 's .
the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] will be held from 5 to 15 march , the same as last year .
the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] will be held from 3 to 11 march , a period two days shorter than last year 's .
li peng to give work report personally what merits attention is that the past practice of having a npc standing committee vice chairman deliver the standing committee work report will be changed this year , and chairman li peng will give the standing committee work report personally .
judging from the npc history , when liu shaoqi was the chairman of the first npc standing committee , the standing committee work report was distributed in written form directly to deputies instead of being read by the chairman .
from the second to the seventh npc , when zhu de , ye jianying , peng zhen , and wan li served as the chairman , the standing committee work reports were read by their vice chairmen because the chairmen were advanced in age .
this way of giving standing committee work report has become a practice .
at the sessions of the eighth npc , the report was delivered by its vice chairman tian jiyun , and chairman qiao shi chaired the sessions .
at the second session of the ninth npc last year , it was vice chairman jiang chunyun who delivered the standing committee work report , and chairman li peng chaired the session .
at the second session of the ninth npc , some deputies proposed that the chairman deliver the standing committee work report . this proposal reflected the aspiration and voice of people 's congress organizations at various levels .
according to relevant persons , such a change in the form of the session conforms to the important role the npc plays in the state 's legislative work and is also a need in the further development of the people 's congress work .
people here said : since he was elected as chairman of the ninth npc standing committee in 1998 , li peng has acquired a deep understanding of people 's congress work and made many achievements in legislative investigations and research and in strengthening the legal system .
that li peng delivers the standing committee work report is conducive for the npc to open up a new situation in the new century , to make its work more transparent , and to gear its work more to the needs of the society and the public .
in addition , the press center of the " two sessions " will also make arrangements for local provincial and municipal leaders to be interviewed collectively by chinese and foreign reporters .
president jiang 's important speech shows the importance and urgency of strengthening the construction of commanding units in the new period .
it is an important link in implementing these " guidelines " to deeply understand the state central military commission 's military strategic principles in the new period and to correctly grasp fundamental standards for the construction of headquarters .
focusing on and doing well the construction of headquarters in the new period according to the spirit of the " guidelines " is a long - term strategic task .
this theme will promote new developments in the campaign of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun and is significant .
old - generation revolutionaries , including liu shaoqi , zhou enlai , zhu de , deng xiaoping and chen yun , also wrote words of commendation to highly praise the lei feng spirit .
the whole party , entire military and the people of the whole country warmly responded , and a mass campaign of learning from lei feng burgeoned rapidly in china .
we must educate and direct the young rank and file to strengthen their revolutionary beliefs like lei feng and li xiangqun did .
we must educate and lead the young rank and file to carry out the spirit of sacrifice and contribution like lei feng and li xiangqun did , and to transform their love of the country into dedication to serving the country .
if we implement this principle in the campaigns of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun , we must arouse and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the young rank and file to the utmost extent and let them maintain high enthusiasm in their training .
we must organize and hold campaigns for training soldiers in their posts and various forms of competition . through these , we can arouse the desire of the broad masses of rank and file to contend , compete , research and blaze new trails .
to develop well the campaigns of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun , one of the very important principles is that leaders and political units at all levels must strengthen their sense of political responsibility and truly strengthen their organization and leadership .
communist youth leagues have specific advantages in contacting and uniting youth .
grassroots communist youth leagues must fully play their role as an important body and leader in the campaigns of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun .
they must closely focus on the theme of cultivating high - quality young soldiers and unceasingly enrich the content and form of young soldiers study .
we must effectively carry out the campaigns of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun into the new century .
whether there is reunification or separation concerns the fundamental interests of the chinese nation .
we are firmly opposed to all separatist acts . on this count , there is no room for compromise .
if one were to abandon the one - china principle and even try by various means to seek different forms of independence with the aim of separation , however , it would only draw the two sides of the strait to the abyss of a war .
the stand of the chinese government and people is very clear , this is , we will never tolerate , indulge , or look indifferently at any plot to split china .
when all political means are to no avail , we resolutely will adopt all necessary means , including the use of force . this is a necessary option that we have no alternative but to take under certain conditions .
there is only one china in the world ; taiwan is part of the chinese territory ; and china 's territory and sovereignty must not be separated .
on the question of achieving the reunification of the motherland , we do not commit to renouncing the use of force . this is entirely directed at the separatist forces in taiwan and the foreign forces attempting to invade and occupy taiwan .
persisting in " taiwan independence " means war between the two sides of the strait .
in the major event that taiwan is separated from china under whatever name , we shall be duty - bound to take drastic measures , including the use of force , to defend china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
this is the strong will of the entire chinese people , as well as the sacred mission shouldered by the chinese people 's liberation army in the struggle to defend state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the one - china principle is the cornerstone of the chinese government 's policy toward taiwan . it is also the focus of the diplomatic struggle waged between china and the united states over the taiwan issue .
first , upholding the one - china principle is a precondition to the development of sino - us relations .
it is precisely because of the us commitment to the " one - china " policy that relations between china and the united states have become normalized and developed and the situation surrounding taiwan has become relatively stable in recent years .
second , violations of the one - china principle have led to a series of setbacks in sino - us relations .
third , reaffirming the one - china principle is vitally important to the development of sino - us relations .
this is because there are many hidden perils in us policies toward china .
even as the taiwan relations act continues to cast a dark shadow on sino - us relations , the anti - china forces in the us congress are now clamoring to pass the taiwan security enhancement act .
a number of developments have made people feel that us - taiwan military cooperation is again on the rise . this kind of military security relationship may be raised even to the level of " strategic dialogue . "
this is an extremely dangerous act .
not only is it flagrant interference in china 's internal affairs and a serious threat to china 's security as it obstructs china 's peaceful reunification process , it is also endangering peace and stability in the asia - pacific region and the world as a whole .
this has fully reflected the firm resolve of the chinese government and people in opposing " taiwan independence ; eliminating external interference ; settling the taiwan question on their own ; and finally realizing the complete reunification of their motherland .
of the above mentioned " three ifs , " it is fully reasonable regard foreign interference as one of the major obstacles to the peaceful settlement of the taiwan question .
it is known to all that over the past many years , the anti - china forces in the united states have all along offered the taiwan authorities political and military support .
to a certain extent , it could be said that it is us interference that has caused taiwan 's separation from the mainland of the motherland .
since the 1990s , along with the disintegration of the bipolar structure , china has gradually enhanced her international position .
though 20 years have passed since china and the united states established diplomatic relations , the united states has carried on arms sales to taiwan to date with the result that the taiwan authorities have regarded military strength as a weight for resisting reunification with force .
incomplete statistics showed that in the 1950-1987 period , the contract value of the us arms sales to taiwan reached almost $ 6.4 billion . however , in a 10 - year period between 1988 and 1997 , it rose to as high as $ 11.38 billion .
besides , the anti - china forces in the united states have also tried to forge closer allied ties with taiwan and have stepped up their efforts aimed at defending taiwan through coordination .
last year , the us congress passed a resolution with an eye on including taiwan in the us tmd [ theater missile defense ] program .
in february of this year , noisily advocated by some anti - china congressmen , the us house of representatives flagrantly passed a bill called " taiwan security enhancement law " and tried to turn it into a binding document in the form of law .
it is thus clear from the above mentioned facts that the anti - china forces in the united states have never stopped their activities aimed at meddling in the taiwan question and interfering in our country 's internal affairs .
the anti - china forces in the united states are not only the root cause of the taiwan question but also a major external factor for delaying the settlement of the taiwan question for a long time .
settling the taiwan question and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland as early as possible is where the fundamental interests of the whole chinese people , including the taiwan people , lie and is beneficial to the sino - us relations development for a long time to come .
the chinese people are unwilling to see a conflict breaking out between china and the united states due to the us interference on the taiwan question and this conforms with not only the interests of the chinese people but also the interests of the american people .
blair said that his visit is a major step in resuming army - to - army relations .
he reiterated his government 's stance of sticking to the " one - china " policy .
deputy chief of general staff xiong guangkai was present at the meeting .
he said the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " manifested the chinese government 's consistent stand on the taiwan issue and reflected all chinese people 's aspiration . the great cause of china 's reunification is irresistible .
blair and his entourage is the first high - level us military delegation to visit china officially since us - led nato bombed the chinese embassy in the federal republic of yugoslavia in may 1999 .
he also stressed that china has all along been pursuing a foreign policy of peace and independence and advocating resolving differences among countries peacefully through consultations and dialogue on an equal footing .
china hopes that peace , stability , and development of the world will be maintained . china will never constitute a threat to the united states .
blair said that china and the united states share common interests in safeguarding peace and development in the asia - pacific region and the world at large .
the united states upholds the principle of one china .
xiong guangkai , deputy chief of general staff of the people 's liberation army , was present at the meeting .
beijing , 29 feb (zxs) - - with an expanding population and a rapid economic and social development , shortage of water resources has become increasingly severe in china , which is an enormous threat to china 's future sustainable development .
it was learned that an average of approximately 400 million mu of cultivated land is afflicted by drought in china each year .
during ordinary years , the amount of water shortage in irrigated areas across the country is 30 billion cubic meters per year and in urban areas is 6 billion cubic meters .
the total amount of waste water produced each year is nearly 60 billion tonnes , 80 percent of which was discharged directly into water areas without being processed .
investigation and evaluation of china 's more than 700 key rivers shows that nearly 50 percent of river stretches and more than 90 percent of urban riverside water areas are polluted .
wang shucheng maintained that the water resource situation is also an important factor restricting grand western development .
western regions , especially the northwestern region , have vast expanses of land , a shortage of water resources , severe water and soil erosion , and an extremely fragile ecological environment .
as a result , water resources are resources of the greatest strategic significance in western regions . developing and using water resources rationally is an important part of implementing the grand western development plan .
politburo member and vice premier qian qichen addressed the meeting , noting that : that the taiwan problem cannot go unsolved indefinitely , is the consistent chinese position , nothing new .
qian qichen said that : the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland has always been a major matter of most concern among overseas chinese .
the white paper that we issued recently on the one - china principle aroused widespread attention internationally , bringing a zealous response from the masses of overseas chinese .
after the white paper was issued , certain foreign media held that china 's policy on solving the taiwan problem had changed sharply , which is not so .
our policy on " peaceful reunification under one country , two systems " has not changed , with president jiang zemin 's eight - point proposal remaining unchanged , all of which was stated quite clearly in the white paper .
as to the fact that the taiwan problem cannot go unsolved indefinitely , that is also the consistent chinese position , nothing new .
if the taiwan authorities forever refuse to negotiate with us , what are we to do ?
how could we renounce national reunification ? "
qian qichen affirmed in his address the outstanding accomplishments of the all - china federation of returned overseas chinese and its overall 2000 work requirements .
he said that : since the all - china federation of returned overseas chinese is a mass organization led by the party , its work has to rely on its own vitality .
the all - china federation of returned overseas chinese has proposed placing its 2000 work focus on better " organization and dynamism , " which new substance is very good .
we need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing china through science and education and sharply developing western china .
we need to establish widespread contacts with s & t talent among returned overseas chinese , their relatives , and our overseas chinese compatriots , to build a go - between bridge for the work of the new generation of returned overseas chinese and s & t academic interaction .
and we need to stress the good attraction of capital , technology , and intelligence , for a contribution to the development of central and western china and the s & t cause .
all - china federation of returned overseas chinese chairman lin zhaoshu gave a work report at the meeting .
and some of the members who attended the plenary session held a forum today on the white paper on " the one - china principle and the taiwan problem . "
committee chairman li peng took part in today 's group deliberations .
during their group deliberations , all attendees affirmed the npc standing committee 's work in the past year and held that the draft work report 's summary of last year 's work was based on facts , and in appropriate measure .
committee member zhang huaixi said : viewed from a broad perspective , the npc standing committee 's work in the past year was innovative and had an actual effect .
the people were satisfied with the npc standing committee 's legislative work last year .
the committee members put forward many opinions and suggestions on the contents of the draft work report that concern work and tasks for the year ahead .
gu shanqing and other committee members suggested that it is essential to normalize legislative activities and constantly improve the efficiency and quality of legislative work in order to accomplish the arduous tasks of legislation .
in legislative work , care should be taken to remove departmental colors , to prevent and avoid the interference of departmental interests and protectionism , and to conscientiously uphold impartiality and fairness of the law .
some other committee members opined that in inspecting law enforcement it is necessary to further improve the ways of inspection so as to really be able to carry out inspections without pomps and strictly avoid formalism .
the ninth npc standing committee today also held group deliberations on the draft agenda for the third session of the ninth npc and other matters .
the three - day eighth session of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] ninth national committee standing committee ended this afternoon in beijing .
li ruihuan , member of the cpc central committee political bureau [ politburo ] and cppcc chairman , presided over the meeting this afternoon .
with the joint efforts of everyone , he said , the cppcc standing committee session successfully completed the planned agenda , making ample preparations for the upcoming third session of the cppcc ninth national committee .
he stressed that the third session of the cppcc ninth national committee is an important meeting at the turn of the century .
the session is of great significance for the conclusion and beginning of cppcc undertakings at the end of this century and for the next century and for the promotion of the cross - century development of building socialism with chinese characteristics .

new york , 28 feb ( xinhua ) - - in recent years , the us government has released annual human rights reports , in which it claims to be an " international human rights defender " and castigates other countries for " violating human rights . "
however , the us government has remained silent about the human rights situation in its own country .
the " 1999 country reports on human rights practices " released by the us state department on 26 february , which finds fault with the human rights conditions in some 100 countries , has provoked a chorus of condemnation from many countries .
the day before , the new york state supreme court had rendered a verdict acquitting four white police officers who had fatally shot amadou diallo , an innocent black man .
us human rights records in the past were well - documented , and the current human rights situation in the united states is obvious to all .
diallo , who immigrated to the united states with his parents in 1996 , ran a roadside kiosk in new york .
his work visa had expired , and he was about to renew it .
after the incident , only a wallet was found in diallo 's pocket ; there was no gun whatsoever .
after a yearlong trial , the court found the four police officers not guilty .
this has inevitably aroused strong displeasure among the public .
as a matter of fact , the diallo incident was by no means an isolated case .
wanton application of violence by the police is only one example of how americans ' civil rights are being trampled upon .
although us law contains anti - racial discrimination clauses , racial discrimination is a bad old habit that dies hard in the united states .
in real life , people of minority groups face unfair treatment in employment , promotion , and many other areas .
it is no wonder that , upon learning of the court verdict in the diallo case , angry crowds shouted : " there is no fairness and justice to speak of " in the united states .
champions of the rights and interests of african - americans have said that they would take mass protests to washington d.c. , in an effort to press the federal government to take practical measures to protect civil rights .
the federal bureau of investigation and the justice department have promised an investigation into the trial of the diallo case .
people are waiting for a fair conclusion .
the diallo case has once again shown that the " international human rights defender " is trampling upon human rights .
the us government should seriously review its own human rights situation and should refrain from grossly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of " protecting human rights . "
beijing , 29 feb ( xinhua ) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao today expressed indignation at accusations on hong kong 's human rights situation made by the united states regardless of actual facts .
the us department of state 's human rights report recently made accusations on hong kong 's human rights situation .
protected by the basic law , the broad masses of hong kong people continue to enjoy extensive human rights , democracy , and freedom , a fact widely acknowledged by the international community .
he pointed out that accusations on hong kong 's human rights situation made by the us department of state 's human rights report regardless of actual facts is without justification whatsoever [ hao wu dao li de 3032 2477 6670 3810 4104 ] .
the hksar government and people of all circles in hong kong have criticized the report .
the spokesman indicated very sternly that it is most inappropriate for the us side to make wanton comments on [ shuo san dao si 6141 0005 6670 0934 ] and unwarranted interference in [ heng jia gan yu 2897 0502 1626 7315 ] hksar 's internal affairs .
he said the chinese government expresses its firm opposition to that .
beijing , 29 feb (zxs) - - speaking here today , foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao refuted taiwan 's distorted statement that " there is one china , with each side having its own interpretation , " and offered a detailed explanation in this respect .
he pointed out that no separatist schemes could possibly succeed .
some people in taiwan have said that cross - strait relations should return to the 1992 stance that " there is one china , with each side having its own interpretation . "
zhu bangzao said : this argument is a distortion of the consensus reached by the two sides at that time .
the specific formulation employed by arats is : " both sides of the taiwan strait uphold the one - china principle and strive for national reunification .
the spokesman pointed out : that the two sides used different formulations to indicate that they both uphold the one - china principle is a consensus . however , they did not discuss the meaning of one china , let alone reach a consensus .
zhu bangzao solemnly asserted that no attempts to split taiwan from china could possibly succeed .
he once again said that the white paper recently released by the chinese side is yet another comprehensive exposition that china offers to the international community on its principled stand on resolving the taiwan issue .
he expressed the hope that the international community would fully understand this .
beijing , 29 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao indicated here today that the sino - japanese fishery agreement took effect recently [ ri qian sheng xiao 2480 0467 3932 2400 ] .
besides , china welcomes the democratic people 's republic of korea [ dprk ] to improve and develop its relations with western developed countries .
zhu bangzao indicated that the new sino - japanese fishery agreement was signed in november 1997 .
chen yaobang , chinese minister of agriculture , and tokuichiro tamazawa , japanese agriculture , forestry , and fisheries minister , had just held talks and reached a consensus on when the agreement should take effect .
commenting on the australian government 's intention to send a delegation to the dprk to discuss the issue of normalizing bilateral relations , zhu bangzao said china welcomes the dprk to improve and develop relations with developed countries , especially western countries .
he expressed hopes that the visit will benefit peace , stability , and development on the korean peninsula .
the chinese government is cooperating with the un high commissioner for human rights office to hold the eighth asia - pacific human rights seminar in beijing on 1-3 march .
mrs. mary robinson , un high commissioner for human rights , will attend the seminar on invitation .
mrs. robinson will meet qian qichen , vice premier of the state council , during her stay in beijing .
relevant leaders of the foreign affairs committee of the national people 's congress [ npc ] and the ministry of foreign affairs will separately hold talks with her to exchange views on issues of mutual concern , including cooperation between the two sides .
since signing the two convenants , relevant departments of the chinese government have actively prepared for the ratification of the two convenants and have conducted massive , comprehensive , and meticulous study on the contents of the convenants .
while doing that , the chinese side had numerous exchanges with western countries on issues concerning the ratification and enforcement of the convenants .
all these show that the chinese side adopts a serious and responsible attitude toward the ratification of the two convenants .
zhu bangzao said : at present , the chinese government has already submitted a proposal to the npc on the ratification of the convenant on economic , social , and cultural rights .
as for the international convenant on civil and political rights , relevant departments of the chinese government are currently studying it in detail .
at the invitation of the chinese military , admiral blair , commander - in - chief of the pacific command of the us armed forces , is visiting china from 27 february to 2 march .
zhu bangzao said the visit is part of a consensus reached with the us side on the sino - us military exchange program in 2000 when deputy chief of general staff xiong guangkai visited washington at the beginning of the year .
zhu bangzao said that , during his visit in china , admiral blair will meet chinese military leaders and hold consultations with deputy chief of general staff xiong guangkai on sino - us military exchanges and on regional and international issues of mutual concern .
blair will also visit nanjing during his china visit .
the " report on work of the government , " to be delivered by premier zhu rongji , is an authoritative document reflecting china 's latest political and economic situation , and has already received attention at home and abroad .
it is expected that the report will sum up china 's development experience in 1999 , set forth the government 's general administrative program for 2000 , and provide prospects for china 's intermediate - and long - term development .
the " report on work of the government " and reports on the state 's plan and financial budget will contain last year 's economic development situation and this year 's development targets .
according to the state statistics bureau 's initial forecast , china 's gdp in 1999 was 8.2054 trillion yuan ( renminbi ; same for the following ) . computing using comparable prices , it was 7.1 percent higher than the year before , reaching the set growth target .
an economist of the chinese academy of social sciences revealed that the gdp growth target for 2000 also will be set at about 7 percent .
recently , based on estimates , relevant departments of the state put forward three optional proposals - - setting growth at 8 percent , 7.5 percent , or 7 percent .
they were of the opinion that 7 percent is a sure and positive target which china completely has the requirements to achieve , and it will be possible to exceed this target in practice .
relevant reports also will analyze whether the current domestic and international situations are favorable for china to achieve its economic growth target .
an initial analysis showed that currently the international economic situation has turned for the better ; in particular , the economies of asian countries and regions affected by the financial crisis will further recover .
this situation will have a positive effect on china 's foreign trade growth .
besides , china will enter the wto some time in the middle of this year , and this also is a good news for china 's exports .
considering these factors , it is expected that china 's exports growth will be higher than last year , and the growth probably will approach 10 percent .
inventories have dropped , enterprises ' economic results have improved , growth of the new - and high - technology and information industry has accelerated , the drop in prices has slowed down , and social consumption has increased steadily .
most economists have been of the view that economic growth of 7 percent for this year is attainable ; if things go smoothly , it is possible to reach 7.5 percent .
in relevant reports , it also will be announced that a positive financial policy will be implemented this year - - the third consecutive year . by issuing treasury bonds , the state will make financial investments to increase domestic demand and ensure economic growth .
currently , the proportion of treasury bonds to the gdp has not reached the internationally - accepted alert level and prices have stayed relatively stable , therefore a debt crisis and deterioration of inflation will not occur .
in their reports to the upcoming npc session , chinese officials will express optimism on keeping the exchange rates of the renminbi stable .
in the foreseeable future , not only will the renminbi not devalue , but there will be room of its appreciation .
although the increase in foreign investment in china dropped to some extent last year , the amount still stayed at the $ 40 billion level .
following the end of the asian financial crisis and in expectation of china 's wto entry , foreign companies ' enthusiasm in investing in china will greatly increase this year .
this assures a continued surplus in china 's international payments and for maintaining the stability of the renminbi rate of exchange .
the science and technology training of troops is the practice of using modern science and technology for organization and training and is the fundamental way to increase the combat effectiveness of troops in the contemporary time .
in the science and technology training of troops , it is necessary to put training on joint operation in an outstanding position , improve the mechanisms for joint operation , lay a solid foundation for joint operation , and deeply explore methods for training in joint campaigns .

both sides exchanged views on sino - russian relations and other international issues of interest to both sides in a cordial and friendly atmosphere [ zai qin qie you hao de qi fen zhong 0941 6024 0434 0645 1170 4104 3049 3050 0022 ] .

russian deputy prime minister ilya klebanov will visit china shortly and discuss with his hosts bilateral cooperation in the fields of politics , economy and trade . he expressed the hope that klebanov 's trip will achieve positive results .
he believed that so long as the two sides work together on the spirit of mutual trust and mutual benefit , such cooperation in specific areas will have very bright vistas and will surely bring about more benefits to the two countries and their peoples .
china attaches great importance to deputy prime minister klebanov 's upcoming visit to china . he believes the visit would enhance the overall development of bilateral cooperation in various fields .
both sides unanimously agreed that high - level exchanges have an irreplaceable role in continuously pushing forward the bilateral strategic partnership .
they exchanged views on the exchange of mutual visits by top leaders this year .
tang jiaxuan reiterated the chinese government 's support for the russian government 's stance on the chechen issue and the actions taken in fighting separatism and religious extremism .
ivanov expressed his high appreciation for china 's just stance on the chechen issue .
he reiterated that russia would unswervingly stick to the one - china policy ; support the early reunification of china ; and better cooperate with china on the taiwan issue .

russia 's acting president vladimir putin was scheduled to meet foreign minister tang jiaxuan on 1 march .
dixing , a 45 - year - old woman in the rural area of nedong county in tibet has 11 children .
she said that having too many children constituted a very heavy burden to the family .
an official of the state family planning commission said : " china advocates that the ethnic people should also carry out family planning , but the birth policy for them is more lenient than that for the han people .
according to 1998 statistics , there are 514,200 married women of childbearing age in tibet , 36.29 percent of whom have three or more children .
reportedly , china 's armed forces staged five large - scale military exercises codenamed " chun " [ 2504 spring ] in the southern waters , north china plain , and the northwest plateau over the past two months .
military figures say that the features of " chen chun " and " ming chun " are aimed at attacking us aircraft carriers .
joint exercise using new flying leopard missiles navy commander shi yunsheng personally embarked on a ship to inspect the exercise . the submarines were improved model vessels capable of simultaneously launching five anti - jamming torpedoes , sufficient to blow up a 5,000 - ton large ship .
the fbc-1 ( flying leopard ) fighter - bombers , which went into service last november , were used for the first time in the " ming chun " exercise to cover the offensives of the armored troops .
on 15 february , the airforce of the jinan military region used a number of jets to conduct the cross - sea exercise codenamed " chang chun . " air refueling aircraft were used in the exercise to support the fighters ' long - distance flight .
the air refueling aircraft of china 's airforce , a new model aircraft improved from the 6 - d bomber , was on display for the first time at the national day parade on 1 october last year .
the military figure pointed out that china has studied ways to deal with aircraft carriers for seven to eight years . viewed from the latest achievements , if a war starts across the taiwan straits , there probably will be no aircraft carriers that cannot be sunk .
" feibao " can be favorably compared with the f-16 . its load of bombs , range , speed and electronic equipment is far better than other fighter planes in the service of the chinese air force .
the radar equipment on the fbc-1 can be favorably compared with that of the f-16 , made by the united states , and phantom-2000 fighter planes , made by france , in taiwan .
regarding the 039 conventionally powered submarine , its performance is second only to the kilo - class submarines imported from russia in the chinese navy .
the displacement of the " song " - class attack submarine is 2,250 tonnes , its maximum underwater speed is 22 knots , and its noise is the lowest of the submarines in the chinese navy .
the 039 is quite completely equipped with weapons , and is capable of launching at its full depth linear - guided [ xian dao 4848 1418 ] torpedoes and anti - ship missiles , and of laying mines .
it is equipped with china 's latest yu-5 and yu-4 torpedoes for effectively dealing with nuclear submarines .
this time , the chinese navy said it has successfully made long - range attacks with a submarine . this makes people guess whether or not the " yingji-2 " missiles have already been successfully developed and placed on submarines .
today 's guangming ribao also reports that the parent of a student in anyang city , henan , took some people to beat up the class teacher because the student had not been assessed " three good " and made a young pioneers team leader .
i also saw some reports like this before , and they are really shocking and cause me deep reflection .
correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of youths and juveniles to enable them to achieve all - round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in china .
we comrades of the standing committee and the responsible comrades of the sectors concerned must seriously ponder this issue and adopt effective and practical measures to enhance and improve education work .
before the liberation , 80 percent of the population of over 400 million were illiterate , and very few people were educated .
china now has a population of 1.25 billion , 240 million of whom are at school .
this is an amazing achievement .
as " architects of the human soul , " teachers must not only teach well but also cultivate their students well , and be paragons of virtue and learning .
strengthening and improving education work is not only the business of the schools and education departments ; the home and all aspects of society must be concerned for and support this work .
only by strengthening all - round management with all sectors working in concert and forming a social environment favorable to the healthy physical and mental development of young students can the younger generation grow up in sturdy fashion .
most homes now have only one child , and their living conditions have improved ; it is natural that the parents " hope their children will succeed in life , " and that their sons and daughters can be better educated .
we absolutely cannot bring about certain negative or even reverse consequences as a result of improper handling of these issues . the burdens on some students are too heavy at present , and this forms very great mental pressure on them .
this does not benefit the healthy growth of young students .
it is right that the schools and the homes demand and encourage youngsters to study intensively and assiduously ; unless they assiduously study and temper themselves , it is very hard for young people to grow up , but there must be correct guiding ideas and teaching methods .
if the methods are incorrect or inappropriate , the results will be the opposite to what one wishes .
there are many lessons in this respect , and we should take warning from them .
we cannot shut up young students in books and rooms all day ; we must let them take part in some social practice to broaden their vision and enhance their social experience .
schools are important gardens for cultivating talent , and education is a lofty undertaking for the good of society .
in our country , schools at all levels and of all types must seriously implement the education guideline of serving the socialist cause and integration of education with social practice .
it is extremely important to uphold this education guideline amid the complex environment of carrying out reforms , opening up , and developing socialist market economy .
tertiary education is now developing very rapidly in china , and there was a big increase in the number of its students last year .
china has a large population , however , and it is unrealistic for everyone to go to university .
moreover it is not only those who go to university who become talented .
society needs all kinds of talented people .
" all the 360 trades produce the very best . "
these indicated the dregs of feudalist ideology and the limitations of undeveloped economy and society .
we cannot look at the question in this way today .
in the 21st century , china needs to develop knowledge - intensive industries and also still needs to develop labor - intensive industries ; economic construction and social development set a variety of demands on talent .
this is the objective demand of china 's national condition and of all - round economic and social development .
we should conduct good publicity on this viewpoint throughout the whole of society .
the reason why i say that education is systems engineering is that the whole of society must be concerned for and support education .
it is particularly important to step up ideological education for youngsters in patriotism , collectivism , and socialism , and help them to establish the correct world view , view of life , and concept of values .
this work should be done not only by the education departments but also by the propaganda and ideological departments , the political departments , and other departments , and by the whole party and the whole of society .
it is necessary to develop a healthy atmosphere in the schools and among the students ; we must certainly not allow unhealthy trends to raise their heads .
we must step up ideological education regarding bad student behavior , severely punish violations of law according to law , and absolutely not indulge them .
we must concentrate efforts on sorting out the bad social order situation that has recently been apparent in and around certain schools .
schools and the departments concerned must take a firm and clear - cut stand in opposing unhealthy trends among the students and also step up work regarding the students ' parents .
we must regularly conduct education in discipline and legal system for the students , to strengthen their concept of discipline and legal system , so that they will understand that they must observe discipline and law .
we must ensure a peaceful , harmonious , and healthy environment for the students ' studies .
ours is a socialist country under communist party leadership , and we must and can succeed in this respect .
i hope that the leading comrades of the party committees and government at all levels will attach great importance to education and to ideological work for young students .
there can be no wavering over taking economic construction as the central task , and at the same time we must get a good grasp of building socialist spiritual civilization , otherwise economic construction cannot ultimately be promoted .
beijing , 29 feb - - " the delights of spring are all around . "
the " two sessions " this year coincide with entry into a new stage of china 's political , economic , and social development , and this determines that this is bound to be a session with numerous hot points .
at the " two sessions " in 1998 , the newly appointed prime minister zhu rongji issued a " military order " in preparation for extricating the majority of state enterprises from their predicament within three years and proceeding to build a modern enterprise system .
this is the third year in achieving this goal , and attention to whether the chinese government can win decisive victory is redoubled .
in fact , as a result of two years of efforts , a major turnaround has occurred in the operational situation of the state - owned enterprises , and the decline in economic returns has been reversed .
twelve of the 14 existing industrial departments have reversed their loss - making situation , the exceptions being the defense industry and coal .
two - thirds of the 31 provincial - level units have reversed the loss - making in all their state enterprises , and the majority of the others have prospects of achieving this through an effort .
the task of achieving the goal of reform and extrication from difficulties within three years is quite arduous , however .
can the trend of improved economic returns in the state enterprises be maintained ?
while reducing the losses in the original loss - making enterprises , is it possible to prevent the emergence of new loss - makers ?
has extricating the state enterprises from difficulties depended too much on help from the state 's favored treatment policy , or is it built on the firm basis of deepening the reforms and strengthening management ? ...
instituting the large - scale development of west china is a major policy decision of the central authorities , made at the turn of the century , which involves the overall situation .
hence , whether economically or politically , this policy decision is of major practical significance and far - reaching historic significance .
the central authorities ' call for great development of the west has evoked a response throughout the country ; people pin great hopes on this , and tremendous enthusiasm is mounting .
judging by interviews conducted by one of the media here with npc deputies and cppcc members who are about to attend the two sessions , they are extremely enthusiastic about the project , and there are many relevant motions to be submitted .
china and the united states reached agreement at the end of last year on china 's entry to the wto , thus removing the biggest obstacle to china 's wto accession .
china and the european union recently ended the first round of their negotiations , and although no breakthrough was achieved , the stances of the two sides are drawing closer .
the time is not far off when china will join the wto this year .
wto accession is a major affair in the process of china 's reforms , opening up , and modernization , and it will have a far - reaching impact on china 's economic development in the new century .
what in fact are the pros and cons and gains and losses in china 's wto accession ?
how can china reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls ?
this will naturally be a topic of concern to all the deputies and committee members .
as the new century opens , every country in the world is working to enhance its science and technology competitiveness in the expectation of occupying a favorable position in the competition in all - round national strength during the century .
we should realize that although science and technology in china is developing with every passing day , the general level lags far behind that of developed countries .
a recent study report by an international organization showed that china has slipped far down the international table in science and technology competitiveness , which is at a middle level but declining ; this has aroused the concern of people with insight .
opposing corruption has consistently been a hot topic of the " two sessions " in recent years , and it may heat up still more this year .
history has pushed the taiwan problem to an important juncture when there can be no evasion or long delay .
this important policy statement demonstrates the mainland 's resolve and sense of urgency for spurring the process of peaceful reunification .
this year the " two sessions " are thus being held at the important moment when the opportunity for reunification and the challenge of secession are being simultaneously faced in the taiwan issue .
people here believe therefore that against this big background , the taiwan issue will not be a " hot point " in the ordinary sense at this year 's session , but may very well turn into a " focal point . "
li urged the province 's entry and exit inspection and quarantine institutions to do well and work in real earnest in four aspects ; help the province 's enterprises open up the international market ; and contribute more to the province 's two civilizations building .
though our entry into the wto has both advantages and disadvantages , advantages will outstrip disadvantages , and this is at once an opportunity and a challenge .
only by complying with the general trend of globalization of the world economy and further merging with the international economy will it be possible to grasp the opportunity and speed up our development .
li stressed : we must take the initiative to fight a battle in the face of economic globalization .
we must take the initiative to go out to serve our modernization building by making full use of two types of resources , two markets , and two technological sources , namely , those at home and abroad .
li pointed out : under the present circumstances , the entry and exit inspection and quarantine institutions , which are in the forefront of opening up to the outside world , are also faced with a series of new situations .
the central government recently made a policy decision to carry out a " large - scale development of the western region . "
this is a correct and important decision .
china is a country with a vast territory .
since reform and opening up , the central authorities have put the focus of development on the eastern ( and southern , the same below ) region along the coast .
hitherto , it is a correct decision to place the focus of development on the eastern region .
besides , foreign investors were encouraged to make investment in the central and western regions , and the eastern region was also encouraged to give assistance to the central and western regions in various ways .
change of regional development strategy focusing the development on the eastern region is a strategic disposition that china must adopt in a certain stage of reform and opening up .
accelerating the exploitation of the rich natural resources in the western region brooks no delay , otherwise the development of the eastern region and even the entire country will be restricted by the inadequacy of natural resources .
third , in the geographic distribution of china 's population , the eastern and western regions respectively account for approximately 40 and 60 percent of the total .
being a big country , the domestic markets always hold a dominant position .
fourth , focusing the development on the eastern region has led to the wider gap between the eastern region and the central and western regions .
the proportions of the total output value of the eastern , central , and western regions in the gdp were respectively 50.1 percent , 34.3 percent , and 15.6 percent in 1978 , and 58.3 percent , 27.9 percent , and 13.8 percent in 1998 .
if we take 1 as the per capita average gdp of the eastern region in 1978 , then the per capita average gdp for the central and western regions was 0.7 and 0.52 respectively , and in 1998 , the ratio was 1 : 0.55 : 0.42 .
the gap of residents ' incomes in the eastern , central , and western regions was widened too .
this is what people often say " peacocks flying to the southeastern land . "
if we fail to reverse the direction of the flow of resources , the development of the central and western regions , the latter in particular , will be impaired .
fifth , china is a country with multiple ethnic groups , and a harmonious ethnic relationship is one of the major prerequisites for the society to maintain stability , the economy to attain development , and the people 's lives to be improved .
the western region is where numerous chinese minority ethnic groups live in compact communities .
the central government has always showed concerns for the economic development and the enhancement of the people 's living standards in the regions inhabited by minority nationalities , and granted them enormous support in financial aid and other aspects .
in recent years , the investment in fixed assets by the central authorities in the western region has increased by a larger margin than that in the eastern region .
practicing the strategy of large - scale development in the western region can not only accelerate the economic development there , but help further promote the friendship and unity among various ethnic groups .
sixth , china has a long borderline and is contiguous to many countries . having cemented good - neighborly relations with the surrounding countries , china has solved or is solving the boundary problems with them which are left over by history .
since the 1990s , china has opened to the outside world in all directions . one after another , it has opened 13 border port cities and all provincial ( and autonomous regional ) capitals , including those in the western region .
the practice of the omnidirectional opening up has turned the western region to be a forward position and has enabled china to maintain considerably closer economic contacts with the contiguous countries in the north , west , and southwest .
conditions for western development the large - scale western development is a great strategic change in china 's distribution of economic areas which has tremendous and profound significance .
at present , there are a lot of favorable conditions that have made this momentous change possible .
second , as a result of construction for many years , the western region has had a better foundation . in recent years , the speed of economic development in the western region has approached the eastern region , and even exceeded it in some years .
it means that the western region itself has possessed the conditions for a large - scale development .
third , china 's market economic structure is getting into shape so that we can make use of the market strength to expedite the development in the western region .
of course , it is not easy to develop the western region , and it is even more difficult than the development of the eastern region at the early stage of reform .
therefore , it is imperative to make prolonged and painstaking efforts to develop the western region .
for this reason , the central authorities should render all - out assistance , the western region itself should make great efforts , and the eastern region should extend its support to and cooperation with the western region .
several steps that should be taken with regard to the central government 's assistance , first of all , it is drafting a plan for the large - scale development of the western region so as to push forward the work step by step .
as the western region is so big , we can only concentrate our efforts on developing the areas with better conditions first , then give impetus to the development of the neighboring areas , and afterward develop the areas where conditions are relatively poor .
the development of the western region can only surge forward wave upon wave .
fourth , the central government should grant greater decisionmaking powers to the western region in devising economic development policies and in issues related to reform and opening up in light of local conditions in order to arouse the initiative and enthusiasm of the local governments .
this is because the backwardness of ideological concepts is the major cause that will hinder the development of the western region .
second , the western region should create favorable soft and hard environments for attracting resources from other regions and outside the country , and particularly for absorbing qualified personnel and technologies .
third , it should adopt various policies and measures to encourage the local resources , particularly the nongovernmental resources , to be used in its own development .
the low proportion of nonpublic sectors and slow growth is another major cause that the western region was unable to make faster advance .
this is a very important yet very difficult thing .
this is another example of making the best use of the advantages while bypassing the disadvantages . finally , the greatest shortages of resources in the western region are cadres , and technical and managerial personnel .
for this reason , it should not only import qualified personnel from other regions , but more importantly , it should step up the training of local talented people .
with regard to the eastern region , the previous practice of regular cooperation and assistance in related units between the eastern and western regions , which had gained a lot of successful experiences , can still be followed continuously .
for a long time , serious damages have been done to the ecology and environment in the western region , so special attention should be paid to protecting and improving the ecology and environment in the grand development of the western region .
since the may fourth movement , democracy and science have been an ideal of our countrymen .
however , it seams that this ideal is still far away from the chinese .
however , this might in fact represent a misunderstanding zone .
since the may fourth movement , the struggles engaged by the chinese people in their pursue of democracy have always been accompanied by fierce political movements , with passionate mass parades and fervent slogans which are spread nationwide in a short period of time .
democracy certainly is opposite to the political authorities . otherwise , a party cannot be considered as completely democratic .
democracy must have vigor and vitality . democracy must have closed ties with mass parades or similar actions such as strikes staged by workers or students .
as a result , setback repeats itself during the course of democracy .
likewise , in this vicious circle , people have accustomed to this situation : instead of doing rational and sober thinking about democratic progress and doing things in a thoroughgoing manner , people have accustomed to raucous campaigns and movements .
the appearance of this situation has something to do with our tradition , which is as long as our history .
it has made budding democracy disappear in the long river of history by killing it in the bud . as a result , democracy has not been able to form a tradition in our political culture , or become a tradition of non - main stream .
it is only natural that unexpected difficulties will be met when we carry out democracy in a country such as ours .
another factor has something to do with the chinese people 's persistent goal - - a situation where everything is perfect .
chinese people expect that the things they are after are perfect . a perfect man , who rules the state , will become the center of all matters . he will be a major role of the play - - a stereotype tendency .
therefore , our countrymen are not very concerned about whether or not a matter is better than before . the only yardstick they have is whether or not their goal is finally realized .
due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure china 's political and social problems .
as a result , the above - mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created . in fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .
this kind of democratic movement , which is innately insufficient , naturally has left with many sequels .
one of the most serious problems is this : it is very easy that a democratic movement is turned into a ruffian movement [ pi zi yun dong 4028 1311 6663 0520 ] or an opportunity for some people to change their own situation .
it will be very easy for many sincerer people to change their political attitude from extremely enthusiastic to sternly cool one .
when lord ye saw the real dragon thrusting in its head through the window of his study and its tail moving in his palace , he was frightened out of the house for his life .
however , a promising sign , which our countrymen have long been waiting for , has appeared in recent 10 years . this promising sign is that the course of rational democracy has silently begun .
this change may be the best way for china to calmly move along the path of democracy .
this change , that is , the change of our countrymen 's attitude toward democracy , is the result of many costly lessons learned in the past .
during the course of economic development , china successfully achieved a soft landing .
when the asian financial crisis occurred , we were glad that we had done many things that should have been done . as a result , we have safely passed the crisis .
for example , some primary and middle schools place undue emphasis on the rate of pupils advancing to higher grades , burden pupils with heavy schoolwork , and slacken ideological education , thereby giving rise to adverse consequences .
the recent string of vicious incidents involving some primary and middle school pupils and their parents have caused concern among the people .
at a time when people are worried , comrade jiang zemin gave a " talk concerning educational issues . "
the talk shows strategic insight and has rich substance and far - reaching significance .
like a thunderclap , the talk has reverberated throughout the vast land of china and has set demands for party committees and governments at all levels to do a good job in educational work .
in keeping with their actual conditions , party committees , governments , and educational departments all levels must seriously study the talk , try to gain a profound understanding , grasp its essence , draw up relevant measures , and earnestly and vigorously act on its spirit .
to study and act on the spirit of the talk , first and foremost , it is necessary to deeply understand the extreme importance of comrade jiang zemin 's talk .
comrade jiang zemin 's call for approaching educational issues " from the perspective of the rise or fall of a nation 's fortunes and national rejuvenation " has enlightened us .
we should never develop education at the expense of the younger generation 's ideological and political quality ; otherwise , the future of the country as a whole , not just that of a generation or several generations of young people , will be adversely affected .
to study and act on the spirit of the talk , it is also necessary to deeply understand comrade jiang zemin 's important proposition that " education is an integrated system . "
this proposition lets us examine and resolve problems in educational work from a broader perspective .
schools are not the only one to blame for the various problems associated with some young people ; these problems also reflect the influences of society .
to solve these problems , it is essential to mobilize schools , families , and even society at large to work together to achieve tangible results .
treating education as an integrated system will help mobilize all sectors of society to show concern and support for education and to promote educational reform and development .
educational departments at all levels have major responsibility for studying and acting on the spirit of the talk .
educational administrative departments and schools at all levels must steadfastly implement the educational policy of " making education serve the socialist cause and combining education with social practice , " and devote great efforts to improving school administration .
to study and act on the spirit of the talk , it is necessary to fully recognize the importance and urgency of " reducing the course load " of primary and middle school pupils .
resistance to " reducing the course load " comes from the undue emphasis placed on the rate of pupils advancing to higher grades .
comrade jiang zemin said : " the rise or fall of a nation 's fortunes depends on education ; the vigorous development of education is the responsibility of all the people . "
the broad ranks of young pupils are the future and hope of our nation .
their healthy growth and all - around development have a direct impact on the success of our endeavors and on china 's bright prospects in the 21st century .
the people 's bank of china appointed its assistant governor cai esheng as the president of shanghai branch .
on 29 february , dai xianglong , governor of the central bank , paid a special visit to shanghai to announce the above appointment and also set forth requirements for the work of the shanghai branch .
according to reports , cai esheng is 48 years old ; with a level of university education , he is a high - ranking economist .
he has been devoted to the supervision and management of banks for a long period of time , so that he acquires a higher understanding of specialized theories and financial policies .
philosophy , as a systematized and theorized world outlook and methodology , has all along been regarded as a " science of wisdom " in its highest sense .
the founders of marxism further revealed the inherent links between philosophy and social practice , and between philosophy and historical progress .
they regarded philosophy as the " quintessence of the times " and the " living soul of civilization . "
they believed that real philosophy in a specific era represents the quintessential ideological achievements of that era and gives a concentrated expression to the spiritual essence of civilization of every specific society .
this profound scientific conclusion has not only pointed out the position and the role of philosophy in the entire human life , but has also provided a most important and most reliable clue for people to understand the historical conditions and fate of philosophy .
we still remember that when speaking of the liberation of the german people , marx once pointed out in extremely explicit terms : " this emancipated mind is philosophy . "
his remarks gave an extremely penetrating explanation to the social significance of advanced philosophy .
were it not for the exposure and criticism made by modern materialist philosophy against religious theology , no one would know how many more giordano burno would have been sent to the execution ground .
as it is known to all , marx discovered the law of surplus value , and turned socialism from an utopian idea into a science , thus changing the history of the mankind .
however , the " credit " to his great contribution should also to a revolutionary change in philosophy - - his founding of historical materialism , a brand - new system of world outlook and methodology that can scientifically reveal the law of the historical development of mankind .
a comparison of the two shows clearly that the latter is a fundamental condition , which serves as the foundation and precondition of the former .
that explains the reason why the founders of our great cause , that is , the founders of marxism and their successors , have all set an extremely high value on philosophy .
engels once said : if a nation wishes to stand on the highland of science , it cannot do without theoretical thinking for a single moment .
to temper and enhance our ability and our level of theoretical thinking , there is no better way than studying the past history of philosophy .
during the early days in yanan , comrade mao zedong called on the whole party to engage itself in the study and research of marxist philosophy , and to integrate such a study and research with the need to provide guidance for the concrete practice of the chinese revolution .
in recent years , comrade jiang zemin published many important speeches , in which he has repeatedly urged the comrades of the whole party , especially the leading cadres of the party , to approach and strengthen their theoretical studies from the high plane of stressing on politics .
they do not understand this because they have failed to approach our cause from the high plane of an overall social development ; in other words , they still need to emancipate their minds on a constant basis .
further emancipating the mind still remains an objective demand that the current situation has set on us , and has proved an ideological precondition that guarantees the smooth progress of our cause .
comrade deng xiaoping said : " the cause we are currently engaged in is a brand - new cause . "
building socialism with chinese characteristics is a great pioneering undertaking without parallel in history .
judging by the requirements mentioned above , we cannot say that the task of ideological emancipation has already been completed .
at present , china 's reform has entered a difficulty - tackling stage , and its development is in the middle of a crucial moment .
to accomplish this , we need the guidance of philosophy .
to gain such an understanding on the objective law , we must rely on theoretical thinking , and this can by no means be accomplished through observations of experiences or a direct - view thinking .
therefore , our attitude towards both a theoretical thinking and the development of our theoretical thinking ability has a direct bearing on the success or failure of our undertaking of building socialism with chinese characteristics .
philosophy is an advanced form of theoretical thinking ; and is a fundamental stand , viewpoint , and method used by people for observing , understanding , and guiding both practice and scientific research .
everyone with sufficient experiences in life will have certain philosophical thinking , and certain concepts and methods , in his mind .
such thinking is acting on us all the time .
the point is that we should know clearly what kind of a philosophy it is ; and should ask ourselves the question as whether it is an advanced or backward , correct or erroneous , philosophy .
only when we armed our mind with scientific and advanced philosophy can we master the quintessence and the method of science ; guard against the spread of idealism , metaphysics , and subjectivism ; and ensure that all undertakings can undergo a healthy development along a correct track .
this thus requires us to study and master the philosophy of marxism in a conscientious and down - to - earth manner .
of course , stressing the importance of philosophy has a more extensive implication .
this refers to the role of philosophy as a foundation and guidance in the entire spiritual civilization .
our socialist cause is , in the final analysis , a cause which aims at bringing about a comprehensive development to man and the society .
what we want is a common prosperity , which is not only a material and economic prosperity for our country and our people , but also a richness and civility in people 's spiritual life .
therefore , the conditions of philosophy will inevitably have an effect on the conditions of the spiritual civilization at a deeper level .
a man who understands and knows how to use philosophy will be a wise man , a man with a rich and happy spiritual life , for he has already taken onto a road which leads to " the realm of freedom . "
at the turn of centuries and millenniums , the human society is experiencing a most extensive and most profound change in history .
some old modes have encountered severe challenges , and the original economic and political setups are currently being smashed .
today , all countries and nations in the world are exploring new modes , and are striving to give shape to new setups , which are favorable to their own development .
people have to make observations , considerations , explorations , and comparisons nervously .
whoever can correctly understand and solve the problems faced by mankind can successfully seize the opportunity , gain the upper hand , and march at the head of the whole world .
the only way to achieve this is to emancipate the mind , seek truth from facts , and make bold innovations .
the global competition in the coming several decades is expected to become one in ideology , knowledge , and innovation .
all this has a close link with philosophy , or to say , under the far - reaching influence of the development of philosophy .
the changes in the world have brought new opportunities to the chinese nation which has a population of over 1.2 billion and enjoys an over 5,000 - year - long civilization .
the party and the people of our country are currently holding high the banner of deng xiaoping theory , plunging themselves into the undertaking of building socialism with chinese characteristics with full confidence , and are exploring a brand - new road for promoting the social development .
this road is the product of an integration between marxism and china 's realities , and also a new creation china has made in the face of the new situation in today 's world .
during this process , we still cannot do without , but have a greater need than others , to value a flourishing and innovative growth of philosophy .
in brief , our cause needs philosophy , and the rejuvenation of the chinese nation in the 21st century needs philosophy .

china 's people 's congress system is precisely the outcome of the integration of the marxist theory of state power with the specific practice of china 's revolution .
wang huiyan , professor at jilin university , was invited to give a lecture today . the title of his lecture was " several basic issues of marxist theory of state power . "
he said , the marxist theory of state power constitutes the foundation and core of marxist teaching on politics .
only when we clearly understand the marxist basic theory of state power can we clearly understand other political doctrines and deeply comprehend and master the theory of china 's people 's congress system as well as the theory of governing the country according to the law .
before the lecture began , li peng made a speech .
he said , over the past two years since its inauguration , the ninth npc standing committee has held 12 legal system lectures to have its members systematically study the basic theory of democracy and legal system construction , the constitution , and other major laws and knowledge .
the legal system lectures have played a certain role in improving the work expertise of npc standing committee members .
this should become a system and be carried on because it is very important to the work of the npc standing committee .
marxism considers , he said , that the economic base determines the superstructure and the superstructure reacts to the economic base .
li peng emphasized that senior cadres should strive to become politicians who are loyal to marxism , adhere to the path of socialism with chinese characteristics , and are good at administering the party and the country .
to this end , senior cadres are required to study hard not only political science and economics but also the knowledge of laws , science - technology , history , and culture , particularly the marxist political science .
this is the only way to secure a correct political stand and viewpoint , to enhance their political sharpness and discernment , and to always keep sober - minded and have scientific understanding and firm confidence on the road of advance .
the cpc - led cause of building socialism with chinese characteristics is an unprecedented great cause .
while promoting this cause , we will certainly meet many new circumstances , new problems , and new contradictions .
so we should be good at correctly understanding and appropriately handling them in a political , overall , and strategic perspective . we should also intensify studies , be good at studies , and persist in studies .
also attending were he chunlin , secretary general of the npc standing committee .
beijing , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - the eighth asia - pacific human rights workshop opened in beijing this morning .
president jiang zemin sent a letter congratulating the meeting 's smooth opening .
qian qichen , vice premier of the state council , said at the opening of the workshop that countries in the asia - pacific region have long histories and age - old cultural traditions , which contain many positive factors that respect human rights .
although countries in the asia - pacific region do not share exactly the same position and viewpoint on human rights , we obviously have more similarities than differences .
as close neighbors , we have a better understanding of the historical development and cultural traditions of the people of various countries in the region .
asia - pacific countries should further strengthen their mutual cooperation on human rights .
qian qichen said : we all respect the un charter and the basic principles of un human rights documents . at the same time , we should inherit and carry forward the region 's fine cultural traditions and promote our values .
economic crises had occurred in other regions in the 20th century too . financial crises have very complicated causes . it is obviously unfair to put the blame on cultures and values .
now , the asian economy has already begun to recover and we believe that , with their creative spirit , the people of asian countries will definitely be able to overcome one difficulty after another and courageously forge ahead along the road of advancement .
we have every reason to carry forward our fine culture , values , and ideology , and , while pursuing economic development , promote comprehensive development of human rights .
he said : different countries face different situations . it is normal to have differences in our approach and means of promoting and protecting human rights , and we should handle these differences appropriately through dialogue and exchanges on an equal footing .
the overwhelming majority of asia - pacific countries have had painful experiences of being bullied by big powers in modern times . therefore these countries all the more cherish their sovereign rights and national pride .
asia - pacific countries are also one of major forces with whom the international community have vigorously promoted dialogue and exchanges in recent years . the asia - pacific human rights workshop is a concrete manifestation of such spirit of cooperation based on equality .
qian qichen stressed that asia - pacific countries should strengthen their joint actions in realizing economic , social , and cultural rights as well as development rights .
he indicated that democracy and the rule of law are not exclusive rights of any specific country and a unified model does not exist in today 's world .
universality does not mean blind identity . all measures that can truly promote and protect human rights and all organizations and plans that can play an effective role should be encouraged and given recognition .
qian qichen pointed out : the chinese nation has all along respected human dignity and values .
the enormous vitality shown by china today reflects in a lively manner the fact that the chinese people have vast room to freely and democratically give play to their creativity .
china is a developing country with nearly 1.3 billion people . realizing the people 's living rights and development rights is the ardent hope of the chinese people and the goals the chinese government are working toward .
in addition , china devotes itself to developing democracy and building the legal system . our goal is to govern the country by law and build a socialist law - governed country .
she said the workshop is a very important one that helps strengthen cooperation on human rights among asia - pacific countries .
the asia - pacific human rights workshop is an important forum where asia - pacific countries discuss how to strengthen cooperation on human rights in the asia - pacific region .
the current round of workshop was jointly organized by the chinese government and the office of the un high commissioner for human rights . representatives from over 40 asia - pacific countries attended the workshop .
the meeting elected wang guangya , chinese vice minister of foreign affairs , to be the chairman .
hong kong , 1 march (zts) - - in china , embezzlement and bribe - taking cases of government officials happen from time to time , and the situation of anticorruption is still grave .
to administer the country , it is first of all necessary to administer the party whose affairs must be strictly administered , and in this respect it is fist of all necessary to do a good job of administering leadership teams and leading cadres , jiang zemin pointed out .
in view of the situation , tasks , and self - construction reality of the new period , the cpc top leadership has been educating cpc - member cadres on " emphasizing study , politics , and uprightness " since last year .
therefore , it is of special , great significance to do a good job of carrying out " emphasizing three things " education at the over 2,000 counties ( cities ) nationwide .
all this was also an effort to make preparations for the intensification of the efforts to combat corruption and advocate honesty at the two conferences .
the communique of the fourth plenary meeting of the central disciplinary inspection commissions also said that it was necessary to concentrate forces , so as to break a number of big , major cases .
early this year , hu changqing , ex - deputy governor of jiangxi province , was sentenced to death for extensively taking and demanding large bribes , thereby becoming the highest ranking official sentenced to death for corruption in china since the 1960s .
in fact , to eliminate sources of corruption , the authorities have already adopted a series of measures .
at the same time , courts have worked to strictly enforce the excuse system and to eliminate " connection cases , " " money cases , " and " personal relationship cases , " so as to ensure justice in the judicial sphere .
beijing , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - tian fengshan , former heilongjiang governor who is 59 years old , was appointed minister of land and resources today .
state president jiang zemin signed presidential decree no. 30 to promulgate this decision approved today at the 14th meeting of the ninth standing committee of the national people 's congress .
zhou yongkang , former minister of land and resources , was appointed secretary of the sichuan provincial cpc committee prior to this .
tian fengshan , who was born in zhaoyuan county , heilongjiang province , took part in work since july 1961 and joined the cpc in march 1970 .
he is a member of the 15th cpc central committee .
in the motion on his appointment put forward for examination and approval , the state council said tian fengshan is familiar with economic work .
in 1998 , tian went deep to the first line to direct work to deal with emergencies and provide disaster relief in fighting floods .
he has great ability in organization and coordination work , has rich experience in leadership work , has seriously implemented the principle of democratic centralism , has the style of going deep into matters , and is an appropriate person for the post of minister of land and resources .
beijing , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - decision of the national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee on strengthening supervision over economic work adopted at the 14th standing committee meeting of the ninth npc on 1 march 2000 .
the draft annual national economic and social development plan , draft five - year plan , and draft long - term plan formulated by the state council should be submitted to the npc standing committee one month before the npc session is held . 3 .
adjustments that need to be made on the annual plan , five - year plan , and long - term plan approved by the npc in the process of economic operation should be reported by the state council to the standing committee for its examination and approval .
except in special cases , the state council should submit the proposals on the adjustment plans to the npc standing committee one month before the npc standing committee meeting is held .
the state council in august should submit reports to the npc standing committee on how the plans are implemented in the first half of the year .
whenever necessary , the npc standing committee may hear , examine , and discuss the state council 's special reports on economic work .
the npc standing committee should supervise the implementation of the national economic and social development plan .
concerning the state 's key construction projects listed in the plan , it may hear the work reports given by the state council whenever necessary , as a way of supervision . 7 .
entrusted by the chairmanship meeting , relevant special committees may hold plenary meetings to hear special reports made by relevant state council departments .
the special reports of the relevant state council departments should be made under state council 's unified plan .
the chairmanship meeting should also report the outcome to the npc standing committee . 11 . unless otherwise stipulated by laws , the npc standing committee should make public its supervision over economic work .
the ministry of land and resources has already sent the inspection report to the respective departments in charge for their further studies , and relevant departments have also put forward their preliminary opinions on work improvements .
in his speech delivered at the meeting , wen jiabao first expressed thanks , on behalf of the cpc central committee and the state council , to the comrades participating in the inspection group .
he pointed out : this inspection shows the implementation of the system of multi - party cooperation and political consultations under the cpc leadership , and has proved to be a good way for democratic parties and non - party personages to participate in state affairs .
in recent years , the work of protecting and making rational use of national land and resources has undergone further improvements .
the " law of the people 's republic of china for the protection of the marine environment , " which was promulgated by the npc not long ago , will be of great significance in promoting a sustainable growth in marine resources .
wen jiabao pointed out : there still exist a number of problems in the protection , exploration , and utilization of national land and resources which we should not overlook .
at present , we should stress the work in the following aspects : i. we should enhance our understanding of the issue , and ensure sound implementation of the responsibility system for leaders .
leaders are the key to sound protection and rational use of national land and resources .
we should tighten control over the implementation of land resource plans .
the national land and resources plans formulated by the state according to the law have a legal binding force ; once they are approved , they should be put into practice strictly , and no locality or leader is allowed to make any change to the plans without authorization .
we should handle affairs in strict accordance with the law , and increase the intensity of our law enforcement .
at present , out of their local and immediate interests , some localities have illegally occupied farmland for other purposes under all sorts of different pretexts , and have issued land - use and mineral - production licenses beyond their authority .
we should handle such malpractices with severity , and take actions against such malpractices earnestly ; and should by no means settle the matter in a perfunctory manner , or close such cases by making criticisms , imposing penalties , or completing the formalities omitted before .
we should reinforce the building of the contingent of law - enforcement and supervisory personnel for the management of national land and resources .
holding the examination - and - approval authority over the use of land and resources , departments in charge of national land and resources are required to strictly implement relevant state laws and policies , enforce the law with justice , and never play favorites or seek personal gains .
we should strengthen the ideological education among the contingent of cadres , establish a mechanism of supervision and constraint , and guard against the malpractice of abusing power for personal gain through the establishment of sound systems .
deepening scientific and technological training is a pressing task for the training of the whole army and preparations made for military struggles .
it is the sacred mission of the whole army to defend the country 's security , unification , and territorial integrity .
as future wars will be fought under hi - tech conditions , we should train our soldiers in the hi - tech background .
we must closely associate our military training with our army 's preparations for military struggles , strive to deepen scientific and technological training , make efforts to improve the troops ' combat effectiveness with science and technology , and ensure that our troops can " win wars . "
the editorial pointed out that training soldiers with science and technology is a deep reform representing a milestone in the history of our military training .
the editorial said that the deepening of scientific and technological training is a strategic choice made by the chinese army in light of the development of the times .
to change ways of increasing combat effectiveness and follow a new road of training and development , the only choice is to seek combat effectiveness through science and technology .
for this reason , we must have a sense of urgency to keep abreast of the times , vigorously step up scientific and technological training , and strive to make a big stride in our military training .
finally , the editorial stated that the deepening of scientific and technological training is an objective requirement in military training for the development of the army 's modernization program .
improvement in the cultural quality of the rank - and - file and reform of the military service system require us to apply science in our training , strive to shorten training periods , and speed up the outcome of combat effectiveness .
currently , the rapid development of science and technology provides an excellent opportunity for our troops to deepen scientific and technological training .
the difficulty with respect to china 's modernization does not lie in the east , but rather in the west .
and the important way station in china 's modernization may well turn out to lie in the western region .
this view was made public by wang mengkui in his talk at a recent seminar .
the realization of modernization in china certainly should encompass the vast region of the west .
wang mengkui stated that opening up the west is a development strategy that must be grasped for the long term , a long - term strategic responsibility , and not merely a shock work task that can be completed in a short time .
we should be prepared to concentrate on the issue of opening up the west for the duration of the 21st century .
speaking about the phased nature of opening up the west , wang mengkui stated that the opening up of the western region requires careful planning , an ordered sequence and gradual steps .
wang mengkui said that opening up the west requires expansion of the functions of government ; this point is a certainty .
questions that need further investigation are : what are the resources that can be provided by government ?
what policies can be applied by government ?
how can policy implementation be made more effective ?
increasing the dynamics of shifted payment will provide much more support to infrastructure construction in the western region ; this is something that is already underway at the national level , and will without doubt continue .
whatever way these are approached , it would be difficult to fully encompass them all .
no matter how you divide things up , the spirit and substance of such division is always to answer the question of how the economically backward regions can be made to expand on their strengths , uncover their potential , and accelerate their development .
the central region occupies an important position in the development of the whole country : we must pay attention to the development of the central region .
in reality , the various preferential policies currently being articulated at the national level are to be implemented precisely for the purpose of putting the central and western regions together .
beijing , 1 march ( xinhua ) - - after accomplishing all the agenda satisfactorily , the 14th meeting of the standing committee of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] concluded today in the great hall of the people .
chairman li peng presided over the meeting .
the meeting , in line with the nomination of the state council , appointed tian fengshan as the minister of land and natural resources , and removed zhou yongkang from the post .
president jiang zemin signed presidential order no. 30 to release the personnel change .
the meeting first listened to the report made by wang weicheng , chairman of the npc law committee , on the opinions on revising the second draft version of the npc standing committee 's decision on strengthening economic supervision .
npc standing committee member edmundo ho hau wah , after taking the office of the chief executive of the macao special administrative region , asked to step down from the post of npc standing committee member .
the meeting today decided to accept his request .
the appointment and removal of the minister of land and natural resources and other personnel were also approved at the meeting .
with all the agenda completed , chairman li peng spoke at the meeting .
he said : the standing committee meeting reexamined and approved the decision of the npc standing committee on strengthening economic supervision .
the decision summed up the basic experiences of the npc standing committee over the past years in economic supervision , adopted the opinions posed at the first examination meeting , and suggested practical methods for carrying out the work in this respect .
li peng held , since reform and opening up , china 's culture market has witnessed great development , but faced some problems that should be quickly resolved as well .
li peng said : another important task of the meeting was to prepare for the third session of the ninth people 's congress .
the third session of the ninth npc will be an important meeting at the turn of the century .
in line with the constitution , the npc standing committee should be responsible for the npc , and make work report to it .
thank you mr. chairman , thank you all for graciously attending this seminar .
my own life is linked to the cause of china 's reforms .
the fact that reform is the main topic of this seminar today is a tremendous honor for mew , and also a spur to me .
i will now give my own observations in reviewing the more than 20 years of reform in china and will also look toward the future of the reforms ; please make your criticisms .
china 's reforms have achieved very great success .
the basic yardstick of this success is that the outline of a market economy based on mixed ownership has now emerged .
during the past 20 years , there has been an initial change in the previous situation of single rule by the planned economy .
take industry , for instance ; the output value of state enterprises in industry as a whole declined from 78 percent in 1978 to 33 percent last year , while the share of non - state - owned economy has risen from 22.2 percent to 67 percent .
under the impetus of market forces , china 's economy has developed at flying speed in the past 20 years , and living standards have risen everywhere ; this point is recognized by the world .
we must also realize however that from the angle of changing the pattern of resource allocation , we have not yet made the big breakthrough in reform .
the 14th party congress specifically pointed out that the basic content of economic reform is to change the pattern of resource allocation and switch from planned economy to market economy which exploits the basic nature of the market in resource allocation .
although the proportion of state - owned economy in gdp is not high now , being only about one - third , in terms of the amount of economic resources it takes up , state - owned economy still occupies the main position .
and the reform of the state - owned economy is by no means satisfactory , and we are very far from being able to say that the market is now playing a basic role in this part of resource allocation .
in this way , state - owned economy which consumes two - thirds of the capital resources that are in shortest supply only contributes one - third of gdp . this is the general source of the many economic problems now besetting us .
we could cite many similar problems ; for instance , the lowering of the efficiency of state - owned economy leads to fragility in the financial system , and so on .
i will only talk about one point here : the rural problem .
that the income level and living standards of the peasants cannot be improved has now become a serious economic and social problem .
why do the peasants have no money ?
how can they be enabled to get rich ?
from the viewpoint of economics , a key condition is to shift 150 to 200 million surplus rural laborers to nonagricultural occupations .
why did this shift come to a halt 10 years after the reforms were launched , and a shift back actually occurred ?
it is because our industry and commerce lack creative vitality , or else their vitality has not been exploited .
there are two aspects to this question , one is that state - owned economy has not been fundamentally revamped , and the other is that non - state - owned economy has not been properly developed .
why did this state of affairs come about ?
i think an important reason is that some people possess extremely complex and deep - rooted vested interests in the old state - owned economy .
in particular , the cream of society has major interests in the old state - owned economy .
thus , we will encounter very great resistance in reforming and reorganizing state - owned economy and developing non - state - owned economy .
i recently spent some time in hungary .
our hungarian colleagues , including socialist reformers with whom we were very familiar during the 1980s , told us with great bitterness about the lessons they had learned .
is there a similar problem in china ?
since the mid-1980s the party central committee has tried to launch a battle to tackle tough problems in the state - owned economy , to do what deng xiaoping called " touching the tiger 's buttocks . "
in addition , in 1984 the third plenary session of the 12th cpc central committee issued the famous " decision of the cpc central committee on reform of the economic system . "
reforms in this respect , however , have not proceeded very smoothly .
from this aspect , difficulties also exist in reforming the state - owned economy in china . major breakthroughs have been made in theory and policy since the 15th party congress .
as everyone knows , in line with the " three benefits " principle , the 15th party congress decided to readjust and perfect the ownership structure of the national economy and establish the basic economic system for a long time to come .
last year 's fourth plenary session of the 15th cpc central committee made the guidelines of the 15th party congress more specific .
it should be said that the guidelines and policies of the cpc central committee and the chinese government are correct , and the problem now is to implement them .
in the past two years a phenomenon has existed which causes anxiety , that is , there is a trend in the state - owned departments to neglect reform and reorganization and to enthusiastically engage in " rushing to the ministries for money . "
in order to overcome the current insufficiency of demand , the fiscal system has adopted the methods of issuing bonds and increasing taxes to mobilize resources , to be used in boosting demand and promoting economic growth .
if , however , this is turned into a long - term policy for mobilizing nongovernmental resources and saving state enterprises , this will cause a whole series of negative microeconomic and macroeconomic consequences .
first of all , intensifying the government role in resource allocation cannot enhance overall national economic efficiency .
in addition , using this method over a long period will excessively increase the treasury burden and threaten economic and social stability .
still more important , if the state enterprises neglect their own reform and reorganization because they are enthusiastically engaged in securing state resource injections , the result will be duplication and strengthening of the old setup .
what are the ways out for us in these circumstances ?
all this work is very arduous .
judging by the process of reorganization now under way in a number of large departments , such as petrochemicals , telecommunications , electric power , and the metallurgical industry , many deep - seated problems have been encountered in this respect .
take enterprise systems , for instance ; it is necessary not only to resolve some system problems that formed under the planned economy , but also to resolve some system problems that formed in the process of delegating powers and benefits during the past 20 years .
we can only summon up the resolve to carry out fundamental reform and reorganization .
what is the correct guideline for resolving these problems ?
i think we should persist in implementing the cpc central committee decisions since the third plenary session of the 14th central committee , and especially the guidelines of the 15th party congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15th central committee .
with regard to joining the world trade organization , one recent reaction has been blind optimism and the belief that china will profit whatever it does .
there is also the idea that " the wolf is here . "
however we nave not done anything like enough regarding what practical steps to take to ensure true vitality for our native economy .
in addition , instead of devoting efforts to fundamentally improving the operational state of the state enterprises , we use the old methods of " providing policy " and " blood transfusions " to seek their short - term preservation ; and so on and so forth .
unless we break through these areas of misunderstanding , it will be very hard to implement the decisions of the 15th party congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15th central committee .
the second way out lies in vigorously promoting the development of non - state - owned economy .
second , the government at all levels must without discrimination clear away the obstacles to the development of all enterprises , including revamped state enterprises and also enterprises set up by nongovernmental bodies , and create a good operational environment for them .
we are glad that a number of regions have now emerged that have implemented the central policies and guidelines relatively well , with the result that their economy is flourishing and there is full employment and social stability .
for example , this new atmosphere has emerged in most parts of zhejiang province .
on the one hand the intensity of reforming and reorganizing state - owned economy there is quite strong , and on the other , economy under a variety of ownership systems has developed quite rapidly .
since these areas where objective conditions are not particularly good can achieve this , other areas where conditions are better can naturally do the same .
from this angle , the prospects for china 's development are optimistic .
ding guangen presided over and spoke at the meeting .
the meeting stressed that the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin at the core has placed the task of strengthening and improving the ideological and political work before the whole party as a major issue of an overall , strategic , and leading significance .
to strengthen the ideological and political work , we must put our foothold on the grass - roots level and vigorously reinforce our awareness of seizing the ideological front , noted the meeting .
we should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .
exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .
the meeting urged efforts to summarize a number of advanced models and experiences in the ideological and political work .
it is necessary to organize the publication of a batch of articles that carry a lot of weight and enjoy great profundity , with a view to providing clear and persuasive answers to the specific questions that are concerned by the masses .
meanwhile , a batch of outstanding books , films , television series , and other cultural products should also be created to enrich the cultural life of the masses .
from now on , we should concentrate our forces ; conduct thoroughgoing investigations and studies ; make careful reflections ; work out countermeasures and see to their implementation ; and enhance the principled orientation , systematically , foreseeability , and creativity of the ideological and political work .
ding guangen stressed : the " three - stresses " education has a vital importance to the future and the fate of the party ; to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability ; and to the great cause of rejuvenation of our nation .
all comrades on the propaganda and ideological front are required to do a good job in studying , propagating , and implementing general secretary jiang 's important expositions on three " represents . "
however , if war breaks out because of taiwan 's quest for independence , these western weapons will not be able to play a decisive role in cross - strait military conflicts .
the practice of modern wars as well as historical experience and lessons both show that a couple of new weapons cannot stop the advance of history .
these were comments made by wang weixing , a research fellow at the institute of strategic studies of the academy of military science .
today 's jiefangjun bao devoted a full page to this interview , entitled " western weapons cannot stop the reunification of the motherland . "
wang weixing said : on the surface , the weaponry of taiwan 's troops appears quite well - developed in terms of scale and systems .
the lack of compatibility makes it difficult to form a well - integrated force .
he said : taiwan 's troops have another fatal weakness , namely , they are too dependent on other countries and are subject to many restrictions .
depletion is alarming in modern hi - tech wars . the more advanced the weaponry , the greater the depletion due to destruction from attacks and the war itself .
if the " pro - independence " splittist forces are bent on splitting the motherland and war breaks out as a result , the weaponry of taiwan 's troops simply cannot afford the depletion .
moreover , since taiwan cannot make any of the hi - tech weapons , the initiative to make replenishments is in the hands of others .
it has no say in the matter at all .
on the decisive factors in the outcome of war , he said : taiwan 's weaknesses in terms of political , geographical , climatic , war potential and other factors are things that no advanced weaponry can make up .
taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high - performance weapons into play .
these conditions of taiwan 's troops greatly affect their overall combat effectiveness .
there is some truth in this .
first , they are doing their best to please the united states by making military purchases and trying to drag the americans down into the water by putting more money in their pocket .
they are hoping to obstruct the reunification of the motherland by forming an alliance with the united states and japan . second , they are trying to highlight us support and assistance to the taiwan authorities through us arms sales to taiwan in order to deceive the public .
the taiwan authorities are doing the biggest blaspheme against peaceful cross - strait trade and hurling the biggest insult at the chinese people on both sides of the strait by purchasing arms to split the motherland and seeking independence .

the appalling news shocked the whole country .
in april 1999 , two high school students launched a " campus war " and fatally shot 12 students and a teacher and wounded 25 others in colorado . the two " gunners " had to kill themselves at the end .
in may of the same year , at a high school in georgia , a student opened fire and wounded six schoolmates .
" the gun - related disasters at schools are more dangerous than tigers . " this is the true portrayal of tragic cases at schools today and has become a serious issue of human rights in the united states now .
according to us mass media , at least one serious criminal case took place in 10 percent of schools in the united states each year and more and more cases involved gunshots .
according to a statistical report , an average of 15 youngsters would be killed by gunshots each year among 100,000 youngsters .
from 1985 to 1995 , the number of juvenile criminal cases increased by 200 percent , of which gunshot cases increased by 300 percent .
in 1997 , 6,044 gun - killing cases involved youngsters from 15 to 24 years old .
now , kayla rolland used her innocent blood to add another painful tragedy in the record of human rights in the united states .
the gun - shooting crimes committed by american youngsters , including those by children , are the direct evil consequence of an overflow of guns .
according to an estimate by the us department of justice , the american people now possess approximately 235 million pieces of guns , almost one for every person , and the number of cases related to gunshots reached some one million .
in recent years , the broad masses of american people strongly called for banning guns . nevertheless , their appeals were obstructed by the american rifle association , which has great economic power and political backing .
the association could spend $ 1.5 million in two months for lobbying and make those congressmen reject the gun control act supported by the overwhelming majority of american people .
bob chase , president of the national education association , could not but angrily question : " when can we protect our children instead of protecting guns ? "
the violent culture and environment in the united states bring on the frequent gunshots on campus .
according to a statistical report , an average of approximately 20 violent scenes will be shown in each hour of tv programs for children in the united states .
according to another study , a child in the united states will have seen 40,000 " performing " killers and 200,000 theatrical violent actions when reaching the age of 18 .
safeguarding children and youngsters is an important part of protecting human rights .
whether children and youngsters can safely and healthily grow up is one of the most important indexes in judging the situation of human rights in a country .
the frequent happenings of campus disasters have , in one aspect , deeply exposed the worrisome human rights situation in the united states .
an ironic thing was that , shortly before the disaster at buell elementary school , the us government released its annual " country reports on human rights practices . "
the report criticizes human rights situation in other countries and stops at nothing to attack other countries , while not uttering a single word about its own deteriorating human rights situation .
this has fully exposed the dual standards and hypocritical nature of the united states on the issue of human rights and can only be ridiculed by people in the world .
otherwise , kayla rolland and other innocent victims of us campus disasters can never rest in peace !
this marks a great advance in the application of chinese - language mobile internet technology .
according to the agreement , both sides will actively establish a nokia wap ( wireless application protocol ) platform for mobile internet service and the sohu company will be responsible for providing the platform with network information content .
this cooperation will enable mobile telephone users in china to rapidly download the sohu website , acquire real - time information in fields , such as news , finance , and leisure , and complete mobile electronic commercial deals through handsets .
moreover , the upgraded mobile internet service will help further upgrade or improve traditional technologies so that the users also can get information and service when they are not on - line and thus greatly enhance the practical function of mobile internet service .
it has been reported that china has more than 400 million mobile telephone users at present and moreover , the number of the users is expanding continuously every year .
beijing , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - renmin ribao , guangming ribao , and " qiushi " magazine on 1 march respectively carry the full text of the " remarks on education " made by general secretary jiang zemin on 1 february .
the ministry of education issued a notice today calling on the educational front to conscientiously study , deeply understand , and resolutely implement the spirit of the " remarks " and to strive to create a new situation in china 's educational reform and development .
all categories of schools at various levels should put moral education in the first position and attend to it in real terms .
it is necessary to conscientiously study the situation with young students ' thinking and moral characters in the new situation ; to conduct education on patriotism , collectivism , and socialism ; and to help students foster accurate world outlook and accurate outlook on life and value .
meanwhile , the ideological and political education , moral education , and the education on discipline , legal system , and mental health should be deemed as the main contents of moral education at present and should realistically be attended to .
the ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .
teachers should not only do a good job in teaching , but they should also do a good job in cultivating the students and set a good example in all aspects .
the educational front should generally conduct once again the education and examination of teachers ' moral characters and take teachers ' professional ethics as the most important content to evaluate their performances , as well as an important basis for appointment of teachers .
it is imperative to further expand the dynamics of lightening the excessive heavy burdens of primary and middle school students and to comprehensively improve the educational and teaching quality .
the ministry notes that we should pay high attention to family education so as to acquire the support and cooperation of students ' parents .
the ministry stresses that education is a systems engineering .
the party and society as a whole should show concern over and support the work of strengthening and improving education .
extra - school educational institutions , such as children 's palaces , should conduct rich and useful extracurricular activities for young students .
sun zhenyu said : the us congress has discussed the issue of giving normal trade relations to china every year . the us enterprises have spent lots of human and financial resources every year to lobby the congress and they felt tired of this .
it is now time for thoroughly resolving the issue of giving permanent normal trade relations to china .
sun zhenyu said that he believed that this issue would be rapidly resolved through the efforts of all sides .
in the implementation of the agricultural agreement , china has done much work . after sending an orange delegation to california for observation , china also sent the wheat delegation to montana for observation and signed a contract on importing 5,000 tonnes of wheat from the united states .
this is the first time for the chinese government to import wheat from the western part of the united states , indicating the chinese government 's sincerity in carrying out the agreement .
sun zhenyu was invited by the us department of commerce to attend the three - day sino - us commercial discussions with an aim to preparing for the ministerial meeting of the joint committee of the sino - us business council to be held in beijing on 6-7 april .
during the visit , sun zhenyu met with us trade representative barshefsky , commerce secretary daley , economic adviser to us president and director of the national economic council of the us sperling , and some senators and members of the house of representatives .
he briefed the us side on the talks between china and eu on china 's entry into the wto and exchanged views with the us side on the issue of granting permanent normal trade relations to china .
shanghai , 2 mar ( xinhua ) - - two grand talent exchange fairs were held in shanghai a few days ago . for a while , many merchants and professionals gathered in shanghai , making the city bustling and thriving .
with the approaching of china 's accession to the world trade organization [ wto ] , market competition has triggered a new round of battle to scramble for talented people . " talented people are the most important wealth .
seeking the most excellent professionals is our urgent task to actively enter the chinese market , " said pu xiaojun , senior manager of the human resources department of the ( china ) lucent technologies , who specially came from beijing to personally advertise for talented persons .
this global communications magnate , that has set up 11 businesses and eight research and development centers in china , plans this year to advertise for nearly 300 professionals for more than 30 positions including business and marketing managers and network and mobile communications engineers .
instead of spreading advertisement data , many foreign - invested enterprises participating in these talent exchange fairs simply , clearly , and vividly displayed their images by showing pictures and eye - catching charts with videos .
" we do not set employment quotas . no matter how many they are , all the talents will be employed , as long as they are outstanding and are needed by our corporation , " said a pertinent responsible person of shenzhen huawei technology corporation .
with china 's " wto entry " drawing near day by day , we must have the sense of urgency in conducting the reform of state - owned enterprises .
the shanghai municipal overseas service corporation , a large state - owned corporation specialized in providing human resources and service for foreign - invested enterprises and agencies , sent last year some 23,000 employees to foreign enterprises and helped 300 - plus foreign agencies settle down in shanghai .
shen jianguo said : " foreign enterprises are entering shanghai at an obviously quickened pace .
the only way to satisfy their market demands is to build up an even bigger and brisker " reservoir " of talented people . " this reporter met zhang jie , a master degree candidate of tongji university in shanghai , at the crowded talent exchange fair .
this student majoring in information management , who is about to graduate this year , has finally signed , through repeated observations , a contract with datang telecommunications and technological corporation .
he said with feeling that the talent market was been increasingly open and job opportunities are increasing , but the requirements of employers are increasingly high .
wang shaochang , deputy head of the shanghai municipal personnel bureau , told this reporter that shanghai invited 7,000 professionals of various kinds from abroad last year , some 2,000 more than in the previous year .
this matter goes beyond a theoretical debate and becomes a major issue that directly puts the fate of the world 's six billion people at risk .
does the idea " human rights are above sovereignty " really stand to reason ? a brief analysis exposes that idea is not only specious but also absolutely untenable .
first , the so - called " human rights are above sovereignty " splits human rights away from sovereignty and confronts one against the other .
the state belongs to the people and the state sovereignty is the collective human rights of the people of a country .
losing sovereignty means loss of human rights .
human history up to now has shown that in a class society , although people were mercilessly oppressed , they , when faced with foreign aggression and when the state sovereign was threatened , tended to be united together against the enemies and maintained the state sovereignty .
patriotism has always been most revered by the people .
this is because the disaster of losing sovereignty far exceeds that of class oppression .
disaster does not hit a particular group only . when it strikes , no one can escape unscathed .
therefore to enjoy human rights , one must first of all have sovereignty .
the chinese people and people of other developing countries have known that without sovereignty there would be no human rights ; they have suffered from it and have taken the path of first striving for sovereignty before improving human rights .
deng xiaoping said : " honestly speaking , state rights are more important than human rights .
this is a historical summing up .
" a core threat to the international security " has been an argument used by some western countries to trumpet " human rights are above sovereignty . " in the past it was " clashes between states . " now it is the " violence within the state . "
that is to say that the act of one country 's violation of another country 's sovereignty is no longer the main danger to the international security .
is that really so ?
the form of expression for " clash " between states may be different , but the real essence of violating other countries ' sovereignty and of undermining the interests of the people of other countries is the same .
unjust and unreasonable international political order and international economic order are the most striking facts .
a superpower that proclaims itself to be the world leader joins hands with a small number of western countries in an attempt to dominate the world ; it willfully sent troops to another country to arrest its head of state and it wantonly bombed another country .
economic globalization has become a justifiable reason to violate another country 's sovereignty .
the new york times on 24 april 1999 noted that economic globalization has caused " the inevitable and voluntary weakening of the state sovereignty by the global economic juggernaut . "
it is natural that developing countries with weak economic power are the ones whose sovereignties bear the brunt of the voluntary weakening .
economic globalization is often described as a double - edged sword with its accompanying pros and cons .
but now it does not equally treat all the countries ; it greatly favors some developed countries .
such unequal and unjust order seriously jeopardizes international peace and security and hurts the human rights of several billions of people in the world .
this is several times more serious than the acts of violation of human rights in some countries .
faced with such inequality and injustice , maintaining sovereignty becomes even more important to small and weak countries .
it is no wonder that the algerian president uttered at the united nations that " sovereignty is our last line of defense against an unequal world system . "
another argument for " human rights are above sovereignty " that some western countries dish out is that human value is higher than that of of the state .
the state is a product of the development of human society .
it helps maintain certain " order " among people with different interests ; avoids the destruction of itself and society in clashes ; and externally it maintains sovereignty and guards against foreign aggression .
although individuals form a state , an individual cannot survive without the state .
marxists hold that a state may fall but that is the result of a future society .
at this stage , an individual cannot survive without the state .
if the state does not exist , what will people become ?
it will be in a state of anarchy . people will be led astray and become stateless . or people will become other country 's slaves .
in whichever condition , there will be no protection of people 's life , dignity , and freedom and people will lose the value as human beings .
that is why we chinese often say there will be no homes without a country .
some western countries describe the violation of another country 's sovereignty on the pretext of human rights as " not a dispute over interests but a fight over value . "
different countries have different historical backgrounds , cultural traditions and their social developments and religious beliefs are also quite different .
the value that is dear to the west can only be value in some western countries .
when talking about the war against the federal republic of yugoslavia , us president clinton said that the united states has " won a victory for our democratic value concepts and for an even stronger united states . "
the value concepts of the united states and other western countries are different from or even diametrical to those of many other countries .
those rich countries " think that they have done the right thing but other countries consider that a threat to their own security . "
what will the putting into practice of the " new interventionism " under the excuse of " human rights are above sovereignty " lead to ?
acts that seriously violate human rights including armed aggression , ethnic cleansing , apartheid , and terrorism and that have been acknowledged internationally and by the united nations should and need to be stopped .
but as many acts involving human rights and as the line to decide on what is wrong and what is right remains blurred , the international community has yet to reach a consensus over that .
french daily " le figaro " wrote on 22 june 1999 : " as there has been so far not a single political organization that can determine the progress of the matter , a country 's sovereignty is thus trampled upon . "
as a matter of fact , western countries set the " standard . "
on 5 july 1999 , the us boston globe wrote , " countries are told that if they do not abide by the western standards , they incur the risk of interference . "
it is only the special privilege of a small number of western countries that interfere in other countries ' internal affairs under the pretext of " human rights are above sovereignty . " to be sure , small and weak countries do violate human rights .
some big and powerful western countries also violate human rights , some of them quite serious .
has any one heard of such a matter that small and weak countries interfere in the internal affairs of big and powerful countries ?
so what is the significant difference between the " new interventionism " and imperialism ?
the 2 june and 8 june issues of the us newsweek wrote , " if rich countries consider it their right to interfere in any place in the name of protecting the oppressed , how can they avoid being labeled as imperialists ? "
one reason that france and britain cited in waging colonial wars last century was to bring europe 's light to the dark africa and asia . "
in fact , some already openly advocated practicing imperialism .
on 10 may , the us national weekly noted " a rather shocking case of new interventionism in the person of robert kirkland who called for restoring western imperialism . "
as those argue for " human rights are above sovereignty " and for the practicing of the " new interventionism " run contrary to the purpose and principle of the un charter , they therefore try their best to negate and reject the un charter .
the un charter opposes violation of a country 's territory and sovereignty .
" the united states and nato have practically turned their backs on the stipulations of the un charter that strictly restrict international intervention in regional conflicts ( the may - june 1999 issue of the bimonthly foreign affairs ) .
to negate the un charter , some in the west even absurdly maintained that the un charter and the " world declaration on human rights " are contradictory .
britain 's new statesman on 9 april 1999 wrote that even if there is no basic contradiction between the stipulations of world order in the un charter and the rights expounded in the " world declaration of human rights " there also exists at least conflicts between the two .
whereas the charter forbids the use of force to violate a state 's sovereignty , the declaration guarantees the right of an individual to fight against a tyrannical state .
this is really incredible .
there is an argument that says that a country may not violate human rights and endanger international security just because it has sovereignty and that the un charter 's ban on violation of a country 's sovereignty protects the violation of human rights .
article 39 of the un charter specifically stipulates " the security council should decide on the existence of acts that pose threat to peace , that undermine peace , or that constitute aggression " and adopt ways to " maintain and restore international peace and security . "
therefore those who blame the un charter for giving protection to acts of human rights violation is nothing but an excuse .
the essence of the problem is that the un charter has become a great stumbling block for some western countries to arbitrarily trample on other countries ' sovereignty ; hence the need to remove it .
the us chicago tribune stated that rather explicitly in an article published on 6 june 1999 : " a thorough change is taking place with regard to the concept of sovereignty over the past 10 years .
the idea of the sanctity of a country 's border and the notion that a country 's government can do anything it wants to do within its border has vanished with the end of the cold war .
like it or not , the united states , the only superpower in the world , must assume leadership responsibility .
it follows that the united states must involve itself in every intervention act one way or another in the world . "
the paper continued : " if we want security at home , we must exercise leadership abroad . "
britain 's new statesman weekly on 9 april 1999 stated in an even explicit manner : " the united states has long waged an open campaign against international laws and the un charter . "
the articles cited above revealed the secrets of the call of " human rights are above sovereignty . "
therefore , sovereignty is no longer not inviolable since the only superpower must rule the world .
what conclusion can be drawn from the analysis above on the argument that " human rights are above sovereignty ? "
first , the crux of the argument of " human rights are above sovereignty " is that sovereignty of a country can be violated .
second , countries that advocate and practice the argument " human rights are above sovereignty " are no other than " former colonial powers " ( to borrow the phrase of the french daily " le figaro " ) .
third , hereafter a strong country may violate other countries ' sovereignty and yet brag itself to be a guardian of human rights who is in the best position to stress benevolence .
fourth , whoever opposes to the notion that " human rights are above sovereignty " is an archenemy to the protection of human rights .
a country whose sovereignty is violated should be deeply grateful for the good deeds done by the violator country . if it does not understand that or even raises an objection , it is ungrateful and deserve death by thousand cuts !
in conclusion , if one asks what is " human rights are above sovereignty ? " the following formula will be a most succinct reply : human rights are above sovereignty = hegemonism !
the eighth workshop on regional cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the asia - pacific region , which was jointly sponsored by the chinese government and the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights , was held in beijing from 1-3 march .
countries in the asia - pacific region have been one of the major forces in the international community to make great efforts to promote dialogue and exchanges in recent years . the workshop represents a concrete embodiment of the spirit of equality and cooperation .
we have both opportunities and challenges .
human rights , which is a historic product , represents a concept of development . it is a common aspiration of all mankind to promote the progress of the undertaking of human rights .
different countries have different focuses and methods to achieve their goals of human rights . in light of its own national situation , each country sets its own key goal of human rights to achieve . this action itself represents an item of basic human rights .
however , for a long period of time , the issue of human rights has become , to a great extent , an excuse for some advanced countries to criticize developing countries .
considering itself as the " judge of human rights , " the united states even publishes a so - called " human rights report " of the world each year , wantonly accusingly the situation of human rights in many developing countries .
holding high the banner of " human rights , " the united states has carried out " new interventionism . "
the chinese government has always attached great importance to human rights . in light of the universal principle of human rights and its concrete situation , it has made tremendous efforts to continuously promote the cause of human rights in china .
so long as china continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , china will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .
china has signed the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights as well as the international covenant on civil rights and political rights . now relevant departments of the chinese government have made active preparations for the approval of these two covenants .
countries in the asia - pacific region have long historical and cultural traditions , including many active factors of respecting human rights .
although countries in the asia - pacific region do not share a common position and viewpoint regarding human rights , it is obvious that they have more common points than differences .
they should make more efforts in mutual cooperation in the aspect of human rights .
china has been consistent in its position regarding the issue of human rights . china 's position has been to carry out dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equal consultation .
china will , as always , work with other countries to make its contribution to the progress of the world 's cause of human rights .
economic car competition has become more acute generally speaking , economic cars are referred to those cars whose prices are less than 10,000 yuan and the air displacement of engines is less than 1.3 liters .
because these cars are cheap , economical and practical , they have strong competitiveness in the rental car and household car markets .
in particular , if the fuel tax can be formally put into implementation this year , then , economic cars may probably get the greatest profits .
we cannot deny that at present china 's economic cars still have these characteristics , namely the structure of demand is fairly unitary , relying too much on the rental car and household cars markets .
in china , when the household car market initially took shape , the types of cars mainly brought by the individuals were mainly medium - and high - class cars or even imported cars .
last year , under the situation in which other types of cars showed no noticeable decline in their prices , there was an acute price war among china 's economic cars . this indirectly showed that the market demand for economic cars was not brisk .
experts said that viewed from a long - term basis , naturally , the prospects for china 's economic cars will be vast , but this does not imply that the economic cars market has completely started .
it is anticipated that the craze for developing economic cars will be aggravated this year , but it will be difficult to expand the market demand , so the competition will become more acute .
we should notice that china 's initial success in its struggle against the smuggling of cars and the temporary stop in the reform of cars for official use have provided a relatively good market environment for the development of china - made medium - and high - class cars .
bieke and yage , the two brand - new car models introduced to the world market are more competitive in prices as compared with cars of the same category in foreign countries .
most of these cars are produced by certain regions or enterprises , so the products can only be confined to economic cars or to sales only in a province .
at present , this practice has been regarded by some car producing enterprises as the short - cut for entering the car production sphere . therefore , many enterprises follow this example one after another .
people in the automobile industry said that this may lead to a new round of blind initiation of economic car projects and the excessive supply of economic cars , and may even aggravate the competition of economic cars in the domestic market .
no doubt , this will bring certain buffet or impact on the traditional economic car producing enterprises and even on the medium - class car producing enterprises .
the icac , deemed as a sensitive department in hong kong , and the ministry of state security - - china 's spy organization - - each served its own boss in the period before 1997 and still remained unconnected with each other after hong kong 's reversion .
should its subordinates get in touch with the ministry of state security , they will be considered as violating the law of heaven .
in the 1980s , it was named the ministry of state security after reorganization , a spy organization directly affiliated with the central authorities , as mysterious as the kgb of the former soviet union and the cia of the united states .
using other identities as disguise , personnel of the ministry of state security engage in intelligence gathering and infiltration activities . in hong kong , state security special agents have conducted their activities silently for many years .
the introduction of the " taiwan security enhancement act " can be said as the us congress 's biggest challenge to the healthy development of sino - us relations since the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the united states in 1979 .
in this regard , peace - loving people have to ask : the anti - china forces of the us congress so rampantly interfere in china 's internal affairs , what on earth do they want ?
concocting and adopting the " taiwan security enhancement act " is a very serious anti - china incident produced by the anti - china forces of the us congress .
this bill was initially proposed by jesse helms , chairman of the us senate foreign relations committee , and senator robert torricelli on 24 march 1999 .
this time , the us congress , in defiance of the repeated warnings by the chinese government and the righteous strength at home , acted against the current of history and passed this notorious bill , the main driving force came from taiwan authorities ' bribes .
according to relevant us and taiwan media reports , the [ us cassidy public relations company ] , which has a long - term contract with the taiwan research institute , played a very ignominious role in this plot .
in the name list of senators and congressmen with whom the cassidy company is in frequent contact , half of them co - signed the " taiwan security enhancement act " in the senate and house of representatives .
us congress : why anti - china again and again ?
the development path of bilateral ties since the unfreezing of sino - us relations indicates that the nature of us taiwan policy has not been changed . the united states has always been the biggest obstacle to settling the taiwan issue and realizing the reunification of china .
the us congress is the anti - china forces ' key arena , with a group of anti - china old hands playing an active role in it .
it is something left over in the history of sino - us relations that is contrary to the goodwill wishes of both the chinese and american peoples , so that sino - us relations entered the stage of developing amid struggle and progressing amid friction .
the us congress many times has played an ignominious role in sino - us relations and on the taiwan issue .
over the years , scandals in this respect were too numerous to be listed .
it is precisely under this setting that the us congress has dished out the " taiwan security enhancement act . "
from the " taiwan relations act " to the " taiwan security enhancement act , " we can see what role the us congress has played in the development course of sino - us relations .
the adoption of the so - called [ " public law " ] [ guo nei fa 0948 0355 3127 ] towards the area of taiwan under china is obviously the united states ' wanton interference in china 's internal affairs .
the chinese government strongly objects to the us congress 's move to interfere in china 's internal affairs and undermine china 's reunification , and sternly warns the us congress not to hoist with their own petard .
but nevertheless , people have also noticed that the us government has time and again declared its objection to this bill , and president clinton has repeatedly said he " will veto this bill . "
can bill enhance taiwan 's security ?
the " taiwan security enhancement act cannot possibly enhance taiwan 's security , but will only bring yet greater insecurity to taiwan compatriots .
the " pro - taiwan independence " forces on the island were so elated that they had to " salute " the us anti - china forces .
the us anti - china forces and the island - wide separatist forces should not happy too soon .
hence , if this bill is finally passed , it will certainly aggravate the tense situation across the taiwan straits and undermine the asia - pacific region 's peace and stability .
what needs to be pointed out is that the furious activities of international anti - china forces and island - wide separatist forces will only push taiwan to the brink of war , not to mention security .
as a spokesman of the white house said , the clinton administration would not accept this bill because it " will create instability for that region " .
this bill still has to be examined and passed by the senate and , in particular , has to be signed by the us president before it can become a law .
how to settle the taiwan issue and accomplish the great cause of china 's reunification is the chinese people 's own business , us anti - china politicians do not underestimate the chinese people 's determination and capability of defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the chinese government has declared its solemn stand on the " taiwan security enhancement act " - - a bill that seriously interferes in china 's internal affairs and overtly supports the " pro - taiwan independence " separatist forces .
the united states has also declared its stand of not supporting " taiwan independence , " not supporting " two chinas " or " one china , one taiwan " , not supporting taiwan 's accession to international organizations with country as the unit of membership .
as a result , this education has been conducted in a down - to - earth manner with gratifying results .
they said : defending the people 's peace labor and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity constitute the sacred mission entrusted by the constitution on the pla as well as the most collective manifestation of the army 's basic functions during the new historical period .
the pla should always , in the past , at present , or in the future , firmly and unswervingly consider the will of the state and the nation as the supreme will and consider the interest of the state and the nation as the supreme interest .
like revolutionaries of the older generation , we will certainly not hesitate to sacrifice our all for the reunification of the state and the happiness of the people and will never allow an inch of our territory to be separated from the motherland .
this unit 's party committee has guided officers and men to conduct an extensive discussion under the title " how to win the future regional war under high - tech conditions in the face of the complicated international situation . "
they said : no matter how science and technology develop , the decisive factor for the victory or defeat always lies in the people rather than materials . what we fight for is justice , and an army dedicated to a just cause will never be defeated .
the education conducted by this unit has the prominent characteristics of regarding the education process as the process to prepare for military combat and turning the enthusiasm aroused from this education to the actual act of scientific and technological training .
during the education , officers and men of this unit have earnestly examined and found out the weak links in the preparations for military combat .
at present , an upsurge of mass scientific and technological training has been set off among all pla units , a large number of training pacesetters and technical experts have come into the open , and the overall fighting capacity of pla units has been enhanced anew .
in early spring , education is a hot topic for discussion across the country .
just as a country 's rise or fall hinges on education , a strong and prosperous motherland depends on education .
in the course of national rejuvenation through science and education , science and technology are the key and education the foundation and the two supplement , complement , and are indispensable to each other .
last year saw two national conferences convened one after another , which beat the battle drum of national rejuvenation through science and education loud across the vast divine land - - the first was the third national education work conference convened in beijing in june, 1999 .
take a look at the vast divine land , in 1999 , the strategy of national rejuvenation through science and education was really implemented in a down - to - earth manner : the basic research witnessed steady progress .
in october , a month in golden autumn , the first china international hi - tech achievements trade fair was held in shenzhen to promote china 's economic and technological cooperation with various countries in the world .
by the end of the 20th century , the ordinary people and government officials had acutely sensed the firm steps taken in national rejuvenation through science and education .
in 1999 , the scientific , technological , and education reform aimed at fundamentally resolving the problem of science , technology , and education being divorced from economy made a major breakthrough .
how could the strategy of national rejuvenation through science and education be implemented to the letter ?
the deputies and members pointed out : this policy decision made by the cpc central committee and the state council has hit the nail on the head and grasped the key to the issue .
on 1 july of last year , the state economic and trade commission began to run all 242 scientific research academies or institutes affiliated to some 10 state administrations under its control as enterprises , this being a substantial step forward in the scientific and technological structural reform .
early this year , beijing general academy of nonferrous metal studies was the first unit to receive an enterprise legal person license from the state administration for industry and commerce and turn from an institution into a scientific and technological enterprise , this being a historical transformation .
the education reform was also enforced as required .
faced with a new situation , the contradiction between the education thinking , system , structure , contents , and methods on the one hand and the needs of socialist modernization development became more conspicuous with each passing day .
zhu rongji , premier of the state council , pointed out : faster education development mainly relies on reform .
speaking of this , huang renjian , a member of the ninth cppcc national committee , excitedly stated : " the call for quality education , which has been heard for so many years , finally made a breakthrough in practice .
as the work deepens further , the children in the whole country are bound to be freed from heavy homework .
i sincerely hope that comprehensive development of ethical , intellectual , and physical quality is no longer an empty talk ! "
" it takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three chi [ a traditional unit of length ] deep . "
both the system transformation for scientific research academies and institutes and conceptual reform for the education structure have just entered the stage of storming fortifications .
the deputies and members maintained : apart from seeing challenges and knowing about shortcomings , we should also see more clearly a golden opportunity .
" don 't let slip an opportunity as it may never come again . "
" the screams of monkeys on either bank had scarcely ceased echoing in my ear , when my skiff had left behind it ten thousand ranges of hills . "
it was learned that , although chen xitong is on medical parole , he is still a prisoner serving a sentence and must observe relevant stipulations , including not having any contact with the outside world without approval from the concerned department .
he was approved for medical parole before the spring festival .
it was learned that , at the prison , chen xitong could subscribe to various domestic newspapers and watch tv . his favorite papers were beijing ribao and beijing wanbao . chen xitong 's lunch includes two dishes with soup .
his dinner was quite abundant with special privileges , including four dishes and a soup .
it was learned that chen xitong 's emotions were unstable during the initial period at qincheng prison . there were rumors in the political circle that he once cut his arm in order to commit suicide .
chen xitong is the first member of the cpc political bureau sentenced by the court for corruption and dereliction of duty since cpc assumed the reins of government .
the first political bureau member who was sentenced by the court .
in april 1995 , wang baoshan , executive vice mayor of beijing municipality , committed suicide by shooting himself due to his involvement in the case of illegal raising money in wuxi . this caused a big shock in the capital 's political circle .
on the eve of the 15th cpc national congress in 1997 , chen xitong was dismissed from the party and removed from the important position of member of the political bureau .
chen xitong pleaded not guilty and made an appeal . the supreme people 's court on 20 august of the same year made a ruling of final instance on affirming the original judgment . chen xitong was immediately imprisoned .
in late november 1999 , chen shui - pien [ chen shuibian ] issued a so - called " constitutional amendment white paper " as a key part of his campaign policy position .
but both the focus of his campaign document and his related position on the definition of cross - strait relations are permeated with an essentially " taiwan independence " spirit .
this shows that the " constitutional amendment " that chen shui - pien is preaching and his position on establishing " taiwan 's sovereignty and independence " are absolutely not incidental , but rather an inevitable extension of the " taiwan independence " mindset in his campaign document .
so the so - called " new middle line " is nothing but a whitewash of the dpp position for " taiwan independence . " 2 .
his taiwan independence nature is unavoidably exposed .
chen shui - pien is a radical " taiwan independence " figure . meanwhile , he is a typical opportunist politician , being good at playing political tricks , and at exploiting the news media to embellish and concoct , to camouflage himself .
but in certain major incidents , his " taiwan independence " essence has been endlessly exposed .
he plays both sides , holding that he is very wise .
chen shui - pien on one hand defines cross - strait relations as " special relations between two countries , " proposing a " constitutional amendment " to implement that .
chen shui - pien is using such two - faced means in an attempt to deceive the taiwan society and hoodwink the broad masses .
so chen shui - pien 's tone has again aroused vigilance in taiwan society .
he has stabilized his voter base and expanded his support base .
but since just the opposite has occurred , with this step bringing a strong reaction from the taiwan society and stern attention from the international community , chen shui - pien has been forced to explain , in an attempt to dispel the adverse impact .
due to the strong pressure of the chinese government and international opinion , the taiwan authorities have not yet made the reckless move to make a " constitutional amendment " of the " two - state theory . "
but finding a way to break the cross - strait political deadlock caused by the " two - state theory , " to improve and develop cross - strait relations , is a conspicuous political choice facing the successor after march .
since chen shui - pien 's tone essentially violates taiwan public opinion , severely endangering the security and interests of the taiwan public , there will definitely be no way for it to escape its fate of failure .
among the various work reports that are to be submitted for the deliberation of the npc and the cppcc at the " two sessions , " premier zhu rongji 's government work report can be said the center of attention .
according to a relevant source , this report has substantial content and shows an approach of profound significance .
looking back at 1999 , one can see that it was a year of many major events , many knotty issues , and many contingencies .
in the face of such a complicated and changeable situation , the chinese government stood up to various severe tests , and won many victories on the political and diplomatic fronts .
although china 's exports began to pick up last year and china can see the hope of acceding to the wto this year , to the chinese government , its work of foreign trade and economic cooperation still remains highly difficult this year .
therefore , the government is expected to make it one of the focuses for this year 's work to further expand the scope of exports , make a better use of foreign investment , and accelerate the reform of its foreign trade system .
it has been learned that china 's accession to the wto is not elaborated in great length in the government work report , and this serves to show the prudent and low - key approach adopted by the government on this issue .
as a matter of fact , all government departments are currently engaged in revising and perfecting relevant policies , rules , and regulations on the basis of both the wto 's requirements and china 's promises .
meanwhile , all industries and trades are also studying and drawing up corresponding workable measures , in a bid to meet the pressure and challenges that may come together with china 's " wto accession . "
reinforcing the modernization building of national defense is an important guarantee to china 's economic construction , and to a lengthy and peaceful reign of the country .
the year 1999 was also one which witnessed the greatest change in both the international situation and international relations ever since the end of the cold war .
in the face of changes in the international situation , china adhered to its principled stand , opposed hegemonism , maintained peace , and showed to the world its image as a big and responsible country .
this year , the chinese government will continue to uphold its independent foreign policy of peace ; resolutely safeguard china 's independent sovereignty , territorial integrity , and national dignity ; oppose hegemonism ; and safeguard the world peace .
therefore , expositions on the taiwan issue take up a considerable space in zhu rongji 's government worm report .
the release of a white paper entitled " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " has evoked repercussions at home and abroad .
to promptly reflect public opinions , the social survey institution of china [ ssic ] conducted a swift telephone survey in beijing , shanghai , guangzhou , changsha , wuhan , chongqing , harbin , and other cities and obtained 1,689 effective samples .
the white paper stated that " if the taiwan authorities indefinitely reject the settlement of the reunification issue through peace talks , " the mainland may be compelled to use force and set a " timetable without a time frame . "
however , if the taiwan authorities cling obstinately to their pursuit of taiwan independence , then the mainland 's only option will be the use of force ; the taiwan authorities will force the mainland to pursue that one option .
the senior taiwan issue expert is convinced that , under such circumstances , the speed of reunification between the two sides of the taiwan strait will be accelerated . the taiwan problem can be basically solved in three to five years or no longer than 10 years .
li jiaquan pointed out : the day to elect taiwan authorities ' leader will come soon . on the issue of cross - strait relations , with the exception of ch 'en shui - pien , all principal candidates will be better than li teng - hui when elected .
as to whether ch 'en shui - pien can be elected to be the leader or not , i have three views : first , we oppose him .
regarding his taiwan independence party platform , we will wage resolute struggle and never make compromise with him .
second , we will not be afraid .
in this way , a war between the two sides of the taiwan strait will be unavoidable .
taking full account of him , we mean we should make active preparations . when war starts , we must win .
professor li jiaquen analyzed the situation and said : if ch 'en shui - pien is elected , there will be two possibilities .
the first possibility is that he will declare that he will not practice " taiwan independence , " but this possibility is not likely .
if ch 'en shui - pien assumes power , even if he himself has an idea to change the stand of the dpp , those who have supported him to assume power will not allow him to revise the " taiwan independence " party platform .
his being elected will certainly encourage elements of " taiwan independence " to go all out to practice separatist activities and increase anti - china forces ' illusion of " taiwan independence . "
the second possibility is that ch 'en shui - pien will not declare independence , nor will he revise the " taiwan independence " party platform .
in this way , the cross - strait relations will be in a situation of opposing each other in a stalemate and tension .
second , most people on taiwan island will not follow ch 'en shui - pien . the scope of influence of his idea of " taiwan independence " is limited .
third , there are different opinions among dpp members on whether to take a stiff " taiwan independence " line or not .
the dpp inside is rent by disunity with many factions . some people are not firm in following the " taiwan independence " line .
fourth , there are international factors .
he said : in the face of the result of a certain failure , people with some political consciousness should consider changing the party 's stand . there are fierce disputes within dpp in this respect .
in order to have a favorable development for dpp , i am convinced that it should change its stand . the change should at least include two connotations .
first , dpp must change its name .
it should be called chinese democratic progressive party or dpp in china 's taiwan region .
second , it is necessary to revise its " taiwan independence " party platform .
taiwan was never independent in the past . taiwan cannot be independent at present and will never be allowed to be independent in the future .
the political goal of dpp should be built on establishing a democratic and autonomous government in china 's taiwan region and integrating love for taiwan with love for the motherland .
managing education according to laws is a concrete embodiment , in the field of education , of implementing the principle of managing the military according to laws .
the new millenium is a new starting point .
training soldiers with science and technology is a deep reform representing a milestone in the history of our military 's training .
as our military changes from traditional training to training soldiers with science and technology , it is urgent to solve many problems , from the thought and concept of training to the content and method of training and from the training system to logistical support .
president jiang repeatedly emphasizes : " we launch the movement of training soldiers with science and technology , improve our training quality relying on scientific and technological progress and narrow the difference between training and actual wars .
he also says : " we must focus on and do well in this issue unremittingly , achieving obvious improvements in our troops ' ability in dealing with high - tech wars . "
deepening the movement of training soldiers with science and technology is a strategic choice made by our military after it considers the development of the times .
to change ways of raising fighting power and follow a new road of training and development , our only choice is to seek fighting power through science and technology .
just because of this , we must have a sense of urgency to keep up with the trend , strive to deepen the movement of training soldiers with science and technology and seek great strides in development in our military training .
deepening the movement of training soldiers with science and technology is an urgent task of our military 's training in the preparation for military fighting .
at the turn of the century , the war in kosovo again warns that high - tech wars are not far away from us . the increasingly rampant forces for the independence of taiwan show that the fight for the unification of our motherland is acute and complex .
upholding the country 's security , unification and territorial integrity is our military 's sacred mission .
because future wars will be fought under the condition of high technology , we should train our soldiers in the background of high technology .
deepening the movement of training soldiers with science and technology is also an objective requirement in military training for the development of the military 's modernization construction .
currently , the rapid development of science and technology provides an excellent opportunity for troops to deepen the movement of training soldiers with science and technology .
we must make full use of various advantageous conditions to speed up our steps in deepening the movement of training soldiers with science and technology . at the turn of the century , we face severe challenges and rare opportunities .
once technology can be used to expand activity space , various countries may use technology as a sharp weapon to launch the wars of " territory " and " sovereignty " based on the principle of " first come , first use . "
in this new century - a cyber century , the magic contention for sovereignty of the " cyber territory " has already raised its curtain and is tending to become increasingly fierce .
the cyber century : the " fourth territory " has come to the surface .
whether technology can touch off the contention for " territory " and " sovereignty " depends primarily on the questions whether various countries can expand the new space where they can get benefits and whether they can successfully control this " new space . "
a century ago , the invention of hydrogen balloons enabled mankind to take off the land for the first time .
today , the " fourth territory , " produced by the cyber century , is closely connected with the contention for the " third territory . "
in a cyber century , the economic , political , and cultural sovereignty as well as the military security of a country depend more and more on its effective jurisdiction over the " virtual territory . "
although there are neither tall buildings nor boundary monuments in this space , the information flowing there is more important than the petroleum resources in the earth and is as strategically important as the efforts to defend the sovereign right over territorial sky , waters , and land .
nowadays , a country 's sovereignty can be regarded integrated only when it has fully tapped the potentials of its " virtual territory " and effectively controlled this territory , in the course of safeguarding the sovereign right over its territorial sky , waters , and land .
the cyber world : the " virtual national boundaries " are not clear .
in history , technology not only hastened the birth of " territory " but also continuously changed national boundaries .
meanwhile , in the current cyber world , new technologies are emerging in an endless stream and the cyber space and " boundaries " are even more complex and changeable .
the entire cyber world is the " internet " composed of all levels of " self - managed " systems .
viewing from this angle , the " firewall " and " passwords " constitute the first line of boundaries of virtual countries .
however , this is merely the most basic element of virtual countries . what is more important is the right to control the " information " from abroad .
at present , member states of the association of southeast asian nations unanimously maintain that it is necessary to formulate appropriate laws to not only promote the development of the internet but also protect the interests of various countries .
officials of the united nations educational , scientific , and cultural organization have also proposed the drawing - up of a cyber space " law " that is acceptable globally .
just for this reason , the unclear virtual national boundaries have led to the hidden nature and complexity of the virtual territory and the sovereign contention .
to gain the initiative in the contention for network sovereignty , the key lies in the effort to improve the competitiveness in network and information aspects .
as a kind of cooperative competition , the competition for the network sovereignty lacks a clear rule .
the space of network competition is still under expanding . as long as a country has seized the opportunity , it may become the " spider " on the web that has the sovereignty .
to contending for hegemony on the internet , the key lies in the contention for " high borderland " in cyberspace .
clinton regarded the information expressway as the weapon to contend for hegemony in the world , and kennedy declared that " whoever controls the space will control the earth . " both of them are the specific manifestation of " theory of high borderland . "
this is not only because that the united states is the place where the internet originated but also because that the us people have already embraced a very strong sense of the internet , thus giving birth to countless " small spiders . "
thus , the internet is a revolution initiated by americans , with americans dominating the game rules .
for a long period of time , the united states has depended on its technological and information advantages to display its fist of hegemony everywhere .
for instance , china began applying for entering the internet for many times as early as june 1992 . however , the united states rejected china on a variety of excuses . it is until early april in 1994 that the united states agreed china to enter the internet .
second , it has taken improper means to artificially hinder the cyber technological progress of other countries . in fact , the united states has deprived others of the right of sharing information in cyberspace .
third , it has gone all out to seek hegemony in " passwords " and pose threats on the network security of other countries . for instance , it has exported technologically backward password chips only and has usually left " backdoors " at the key chips .
fourth , it has taken all possible means to seek economic hegemony in cyberspace . since july 1998 , clinton has ceaselessly exerted pressure on the world trade organization , asking it to pass its proposal on " zero tariff " for e - business .
currently , all countries , including european countries , have come to realize the united states ' ambition of seeking hegemony in cyberspace , and therefore are striving to explore new ways of development .
the internet was designed for preventing physical destruction , and that it did not give full consideration to the security of information transmission . although it has been patched up continuously , it remains very weak .
in the gulf war , because iraq had bought the printers implanted with virus chips by us special agents , the network of some iraqi air defense systems were broken down by the virus activated by the united states with the remote control system .
beijing , 2 mar (zxs) - - state council vice premier qian qichen pointed out in beijing this afternoon that to promote and protect human rights , it is necessary to properly talk about them , but it is more necessary to properly work for them .
because of different national conditions , it is normal for different countries to have different views on the human rights issue .
confrontation is not a solution to differences and it is better to have dialogue .
qian qichen made this remarks during a meeting at ziguangge , zhongnanhai , with mrs. mary robinson , un high commissioner for human rights who has come to attend the eighth seminar on human rights of the asia - pacific region in beijing .
qian qichen said that in a country with a large population like china , we emphasize more on " working " for the promotion and protection of human rights .
he said : " at present , the situation of human rights in china is in the best historical period .
this is also a fact universally recognized in the international community . "
mrs. robinson thanked china for sponsoring the human rights seminar and said the meeting is very successful and is conducive to strengthening exchange and cooperation between countries in the asia - pacific region on the human rights issue .
she spoke positively about the progress made by china in promoting and protecting human rights in recent years . she also expressed welcome to the chinese government 's signing the two un human rights conventions in 1997 and 1998 .
she said the office of the un high commissioner for human rights is willing to cooperate with china .
qian qichen said that the chinese government speaks positively of the two un human rights conventions .
since the signing of the two conventions , relevant legislative organs , government departments and academic institutions have carried out much comprehensive and meticulous research and are seriously making preparation for the approval of the two conventions .
this year , the chinese government has again made a decision on developing the western region .
this is of great significance to improving the living standard of the people of various ethnic groups in china 's western region and to enabling them to enjoy various human rights .
china hopes to obtain the support of the international community .
the chinese government also takes an active attitude in cooperating with the office of the un high commissioner for human rights .
the success of the eight asia - pacific human rights seminar in beijing is the outcome of the active cooperation between the chinese government and the office of the un high commission for human rights .
we will crack down , according to the law , on various crimes which have undermined the country 's economic order .
we should provide equal protection for the legal rights and interests of all parties involved in a lawsuit according to the law , and strive to bring about a healthy development to the market economy .

president qi huaiyuan of the association and liu huaqiu , director of the central foreign affairs office , were present at the meeting .
wu yi said : in recent years , with the direct efforts of leaders of the two countries , relations between china and russia have maintained a steady , healthy and satisfactory trend . the level of strategic cooperation has been raised steadily with notable results .
since the summit meeting and the fourth scheduled meeting between premiers of the two countries last year , both sides have made progress in the implementation of various agreements .
she said : under the current international situation , the constant development of strategic partnership of cooperation and the strengthening of cooperation in various fields between the two countries will be of great significance .
she believed that so long as the two sides adhere to the principle of mutual trust and mutual benefit , change thinking and concepts and adapt themselves to the market situation , cooperation between the two countries can certainly be further developed .
klebanov pointed out that russia has attached great importance to cooperation with china and feels satisfied with the progress in recent years .
wu yi introduced china 's strategy to vigorously develop the western region and noted that as china 's neighboring country russia has the geographical advantage in cooperation .
she said the chinese side welcomes russia to take part in the development of china 's western region .
prior to the meeting , the two sides will hold talks on setting up a committee and branch committees for the scheduled meeting .
the two sides agreed that a banking cooperation subcommittee and an aerospace cooperation subcommittee would be set up under the committee for the scheduled meeting .
ilya klebanov arrived in beijing today for a formal visit at the invitation of the chinese government .
blair reaffirmed that the us policy remains to be adherence to the one - china principle and the united states is willing to scrupulously abide by the three communiques .
this was disclosed by chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao at today 's regular press conference .
zhu bangzao said that at the invitation of the general staff headquarters of the chinese people 's liberation army , blair visited beijing and nanjing from 27 february to 2 march .
on the taiwan issue , the united states has made solemn commitments to china and it should win the trust of the chinese people and the international community with action and do more things beneficial to the peace and stability of the taiwan strait region .
their visit has not only greatly inspired and educated local cadres and people , but also evoked warm repercussions among all the party members and the broad masses of the people .
to make the members of the central political bureau standing committee directly handle the " three stresses " work in counties ( cities ) was an important measure taken by the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core to concentrate its attention on party building .
in attaching a high degree of importance to the " three stresses " in counties ( cities ) , the emphasis should be put on practice and action .
in this regard , the members of the central political bureau standing committee have already set an example for us .
during the course of handling the " three stresses " in counties ( cities ) , the comrades of the central political bureau standing committee have taken the lead in doing a thoroughgoing and painstaking ideological and political work .
we should resolutely oppose the bad work style of merely writing about or talking about attaching importance , or acting in a perfunctory manner .
counties ( cities ) , being a link between the higher levels and the people , have direct contact with the broad masses and their environment , conditions and existing problems have their own local characteristics .
the strength of good example is infinitely great .
we must work in accordance with the party central committee 's demand , take advantage of the favorable situation to make progress , and do a good job in arranging , organizing and carrying out the " three stresses " in counties ( cities ) .
beijing , 2 mar ( xinhua ) - - hundreds of reporters sat close together in the press conference hall , with dozens of cameras directed at the rostrum ..
this was the first press conference held by tian zengpei , news spokesman of the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] , at the great hall of the people this afternoon .
" i would like to answer reporters ' questions concerning the current cppcc session , " said tian zengpei with smile , after reading out the briefing message .
a hand was raised high .
" what valuable opinions and proposals have been offered by the cppcc national committee since last year ?
how have these opinions and proposals been adopted ? "
a radio station reporter asked first .
tian zengpei replied calmly : " last year the cppcc national committee held an ad hoc standing committee meeting to discuss the issue of environment and development .
then , it worked out the " proposals on several issues of china 's environmental protection , " after summarizing the opinions of its standing committee members and the results of the investigations and studies conducted by its special committees .
these proposals have attracted high attention of central leading comrades and departments concerned .
raising motions is a major method for cppcc members to perform their functions .
the method of resuming the motions work report at the opening ceremony of this year 's cppcc session has aroused great interest from reporters .
a newspaper reporter in beijing asked tian zengpei to explain the reason .
tian zengpei said : " the method of making a motions work report at the opening ceremony of the cppcc session was initiated at the second session of the first cppcc national committee , and adopted until the second session of the seventh cppcc national committee .
therefore , the current session will resume the method of making the motions work report at the opening ceremony of the cppcc session . "
as soon as tian zengpei stopped , some reporters raised their hands to ask questions .
" there is a loud voice of intensified supervision in society .
vice chairman ye xuanping emphasized in his standing committee work report last year that the democratic supervision of the cppcc should be intensified .
i would like to ask , what progress has been made in this aspect over the past year ? "
a radio station reporter asked .
" since last year , the cppcc national committee has intensified the work regarding democratic supervision . "
tian zengpei added , " considering the serious air pollution in beijing , cppcc members offered , through a variety of forms , opinions and suggestions for beijing 's environmental protection work , thereby encouraging the beijing municipal government to control air pollution with decisive measures . "
a hong kong reporter asked how the cppcc national committee played its role in building a clean and honest government .
tian zengpei answered : " the building of a clean and honest government has always been a hot issue of concern by the cppcc .
cppcc members have exploited their advantages to conduct intensive investigations and studies and have actively offered suggestions and ideas , thus playing a key role in opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty .
a reporter from a newspaper agency in beijing asked : " the extensive development of western regions has already become a hot topic at the moment . how does the cppcc plan to participate in this work ? "
tian zengpei answered : " the current cppcc session has not opened yet , but the secretariat of the session has already received 75 written statements on the extensive development of western regions .
during the current session , we will hold a domestic and foreign press conference for the questions concerning the extensive development of western regions . "
the reunification of the motherland remains the focus of the concern of reporters .
a reporter asked : " hong kong and macao have already returned to the motherland .
what does the cppcc national committee plan to do to promote the complete reunification of the motherland ? "
tian zengpei said resolutely : " the taiwan issue cannot be put off indefinitely , and it must be resolved as early as possible .
although the scheduled time for the press conference passed , many reporters were still raising their hands and vying with one another to raise questions .
as long as our party thinks and acts under this guidance , our party will surely lead the people of our country to create new glory in the new century .
they said that the speech 's incisive exposition on the importance of party building holds profound meaning historically and practically for our endeavor to move forward the reform , opening up , and modernization drive .
member dai ruitong told the reporter that " the tremendous changes over the 20 years of reform and opening up fully prove that china 's affairs needs to be handled by the correct leadership of the cpc .
we should continue to administer our party in a strict manner so to make the organism of the party healthier and lead the people across the country to advance forward .
the speech is a representative of the highest interest of the cpc as well as the fundamental interest of the broad masses of the chinese people . "
he continued : " the contemporary world is now characterized by the rapid development of high and new technology . high - technology industry is booming and the time of knowledge economy is coming .
in economic development , science and technology is the crucial point and education is the foundation .
deputy li xiaoping , from the water sport school of jiangxi , was greatly inspired by general secretary jiang zemin 's speech .
he said : " general secretary jiang zemin 's speech on 'three representatives ' points out a direction for the party 's development , and expresses what the masses want to say from the bottom of their hearts .
in the cpc history over 70 years , the cpc has won the support of people because of doing a down - to - earth job in the " three representatives . "
now , the party is leading the people across the country into the new century , the duty to reform and development is even heavier .
the experiences of the rural grassroots work prove this to be true .
at present , the grassroots party building in rural areas is facing some problems , such as negligence to ideological , work style , and organizational buildings . some things are stressed while some , such as party building , are ignored .
rural areas ' difficulties and unfavorable conditions are not things to be afraid of .
with party building strengthened and work style of cadres consolidated , we will be able to accelerate the modernization drive of the west region . "
meanwhile , president jiang stressed the central government 's consistent stand on the taiwan issue .
the taiwan issue is an internal affair of china .
in the three joint communiques , the us government acknowledged that there is only one china , and that taiwan is part of chinese territory .
the united states should respect china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity . it should not preach or support taiwan 's pursuit of separatism , nor should it create two chinas or support taiwan independence .
however , recent statements and moves by the us congress have wantonly interfered in china 's internal affairs , and this is unacceptable to the chinese people .
in recent years , the united states has constantly supplied taiwan with weapons ; this is the root of the deteriorating situation in the taiwan strait .
this is an absurd formulation .
why does the united states obstruct china 's peaceful reunification and support separatist activities by means of arms sales ?
how can it be in the us national interest to push taiwan to an abyss of separatism ?
is taiwan a dependency of the united states ?
the us position has completely breached international law and the principles of the three sino - us communiques and has violated china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
" in 1996 , we made an appropriate response to what was seen as a threat . "
lockhart was referring to the dispatch of two us aircraft carriers to areas near taiwan .
does the united states still recognize the un charter ?
some people threatened to carry out a gunboat policy . how can the chinese people be frightened by this ?
the chinese people clearly remember that in 1996 , the two aircraft carriers threatened to pass through the central line of the taiwan strait but immediately sailed several hundred nautical miles away from taiwan island after the chinese people 's liberation army issued a warning .
if a foreign country occupies puerto rico , or if puerto rico declares independence with foreign support and separates itself from the united states , will the united states use force ?
of course it will .
evidently , on the issue of international law , the united states has adopted a double standard . while attaching importance to its territorial integrity , it tramples on and has no regard for china 's territorial integrity .
so far , clinton 's position is somewhat prudent . he said that the chinese government 's white paper contains " specific suggestions " on opening cross - strait dialogue .
clinton reiterated his support for the one - china principle .
the most sensitive and crucial issue in sino - us relations is the question of taiwan .
recent statements by some us officials are detrimental to the development of sino - us relations and foment unrest across the taiwan situation .
us officials should be discreet in word and deed and put the overall interests of sino - us relations above everything else .
sino - us ties are hard - earned because they are the result of the joint efforts of the two us political parties and previous governments for the past two decades .
in the new century , the us side should handle sino - us relations from a strategic viewpoint and refrain from doing anything to sacrifice the interests of sino - us relations because of their temporary political interests in the run - up to the general elections .
china has its bottom line , however .
this was actually intended for the development of the great northwest .
jiang zemin pointed out last year : how can we modernize the whole country without developing the western regions ?
with the implementation of the strategy for developing the western regions , the central authorities will be giving preferential treatment to these regions in policies , funding and project approval .
it has been disclosed that the central authorities will be raising 700 - 800 billion yuan each year for the development of the western regions , particularly for infrastructure facilities such as highways , railways , bridges , water conservancy projects and gas - transmission pipelines .
however , a subsequent review by the authorities concerned shows that it has fallen short of the anticipated results .
jiang zemin raised the issue of " three representatives " during his inspection tour . this was meant to match deng xiaoping 's " three favorables , " but did not get good media publicity .
in this corner of beijing , cantonese immediately became the general language .
in the large self - service dining room , politburo member and guangdong party secretary li changchun lines up with the deputies to select food and dine .
my chat with li changchun starts with cantonese food .
while cantonese food has long since been world - famous , and though li changchun has gradually grown accustomed to and to enjoy many kinds of food , he still best likes the regular fare that his family makes .
li changchun praises the cooks in cantonese for their culinary arts , and for showing consideration to the differing tastes of southerners and northerners .
for some dozen years , li changchun has been moving from northeast to central china , and then from the central plains to the southern guangdong - guangxi region , serving in key leadership positions in the three provinces of liaoning , henan , and guangdong .
in these three completely different types of provinces , what leadership aspects has li changchun stressed ?
it is clear that li changchun is particularly sentimental about the places where he has worked .
while a few cities are being required to meet this goal ahead of time in 2005 , guangdong province is absolutely not setting hard targets for all cities , even less so acting in an across - the - board manner .
we are being objective in all aspects .
li changchun praises the deputies at the recent guangdong people 's congress for fully exercising their oversight rights , and for their actions to question the environmental sector , saying that such matters have raised the public legal and environmental awareness .
the last topic in our chat is general secretary jiang zemin 's southern inspection tour of guangdong on 19-25 february , in which he affirmed guangdong 's development , while posing very high demands .
in which respect , li changchun says that all of guangdong is now conscientiously studying jiang zemin 's instructions .
while there seems to still be much to chat about , since a number of other [ npc ] deputies are waiting to chat with this reporter , i am forced to stop here .
beijing , 3 mar ( xinhua ) - - general zhang wannian , vice chairman of the central military commission , met with russian deputy prime minister ilya klebanov here this morning .
amid a cordial and friendly atmosphere , they exchanged views on bilateral relations and international and regional security issues of common interest .
the development of sino - russian friendly relations conforms to the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and to peace and stability in the asia - pacific region and the world at large , zhang said .
china is fully confident that military relations between the two countries will further develop in the new century .
zhang said he firmly believed that klebanov 's current visit to china would further promote friendly cooperation between the two countries in all fields .
klebanov said that russian - chinese exchanges and cooperation in all fields and at various levels constitute an integral part of the strategic partnership .
there are bright prospects for such exchanges and cooperation because they are established on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty , mutual trust , equality , and mutual benefit .
klebanov extended his good wishes for the in - depth development of sino - russian strategic cooperative partnership in the new situation .
the great hall of the people , 1505 , 3 mar ( xinhua ) - - the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference (cppcc) opened at the great hall of the people at 0300 this afternoon .
jiang zemin , li peng , zhu rongji , li ruihuan , hu jintao , wei jianxing , li lanqing , and other party and state leaders sat on the rostrum and congratulated the opening of the session .
after cppcc chairman li ruihuan announced the opening of the session , all participants rose and the band played the national anthem of the people 's republic of china .
presided over by chairman li ruihuan , the agenda for the current session was first approved at the opening session of the third session of the ninth cppcc national committee .
at today 's meeting , the " revised cppcc constitution ( draft ) " will also be submitted for the deliberation of the committee members .
ye xuanping said the year 2000 is the year in which one century succeeds the other .
education on our military 's fundamental functions is gradually launched in the entire military and armed police troops .
this is an important measure to deeply implement the military 's strategic principles for the new period .
doing well in the education of our military 's fundamental functions is an important and regular task in our troops ' ideological and political work . at the turn of the century , the general international situation continues to develop toward mitigation .
deeply conducting the education of our military 's fundamental functions in the new situation is significant for promoting the continuous development of the movement of training soldiers with science and technology , to preparing well for military fighting and to pushing forward the construction of troop quality .
units at all levels must highly emphasize and truly do well in the education .
we must set the goal of the education on helping the rank and file establish a firm sense of function .
solidifying our national defense , protecting our motherland and ensuring that the people can work in a peaceful situation are sacred missions entrusted by the constitution .
the 2 characters that form the word " function " are supremely important .
in general , we must truly instill the sense of fulfilling the military 's fundamental functions into the thoughts of the rank and file and let the sense take root in the work of our troops .
we must conscientiously investigate well and understand the thoughts of the rank and file . we must conduct education by targeting problems in the minds of the rank and file .
this education must be closely linked to the reality of preparing for military fighting and of training soldiers with science and technology .
our experience shows that strengthening soldiers ' sense of function relies on the infiltration of basic theories and on guidance from their everyday experience .
the ul mark is a safety identification mark generally recognized in the united states and the north american region .
labeling a product with this mark , which is tantamount to giving it a safety and quality credit card , makes it readily accepted by consumers .
therefore , the ul mark is a pass for the entry of relevant products ( particularly electromechanical products ) into the us and north american markets .
the saic trademark bureau had examined and approved the registration of the ul mark as a certification trademark , which bears an exclusive right of trademark use according to the law .
this round of activities jointly launched by the saieciq and the other four departments to crack down on the counterfeiting of the ul mark will last a half year .
the saieciq and the other four departments have now started dividing the work among themselves based on their respective duties and carrying out work to crack down on the counterfeiting practices according to the plan of implementation .
because the ul mark has a peculiar function , some units in the country began counterfeiting it in 1993 , giving rise to a stream of such counterfeiting cases .
the emergence of low - quality bogus products has adversely affected the prestige of chinese export products and violated the legitimate rights and interests of more than 4,000 ul - registered enterprises in the country .
beijing , 3 mar ( xinhua ) - - to intensify land management in china , the ministry of supervision and the ministry of land and natural resources recently promulgated a method of punishment that specifically targets government officials who violate land management stipulations .
this was the first inisterial decree signed by tian fengshan , the newly appointed minister of land and natural resources .
according to information , the enforcement of the punishment method will ensure that china will se the most stringent measures in the world to manage land .
according to information , there has been an upward trend in the suspected involvement of government functionaries in land - related law violation .
some grass - roots governments and leading cadres who are eager for quick success and instant benefits , have not hesitated to act against the law in order to score achievements in their official careers .
however , because in the past there was no clear - cut and specific standard for punishments , many government functionaries who should have received punishment were not punished , and land - related law violation continued to occur despite repeated efforts to stop it .
zhang xinbao , deputy director of the law enforcement and supervision bureau under the ministry of land and natural resources , said : in 1999 , 57.9 percent of the total reports received by the law enforcement and supervision bureau were about government officials who violated the land law .
more than 95 percent of these lawbreaking cases that involved government officials could not be processed .
zhang xinbao said : in the past , fines and confiscation were the forms of punishments used for land - related law violation acts .
according to the newly promulgated method of punishment , such disciplinary sanctions as demotion , removal from office , and discharge from employment will be applied to government officials according to the seriousness of their cases .
according to information , land was extensively utilized in china for more than a decade , and a lot of cultivated land was occupied .
one of the important factors that contributed to the sharp reduction in cultivated land was local governments and cadres from land management departments who wantonly approved land , and some units and individuals who indiscriminately occupied land .
he said that the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland marked important progress made in the great cause of the motherland 's reunification .
the sacred mission of settling the taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland has become more outstanding before all the people of the country , including the taiwan compatriots and overseas chinese .
it is necessary to seriously study and energetically explore new ways and methods for properly carrying out overseas solidarity work in the new situation and further promote great unity among the chinese at home and abroad .
beijing , 3 mar ( xinhua ) - - state council premier zhu rongji met with russian deputy premier ilya iosifovich klebanov at the great hall of the people this morning .
zhu rongji said that klebanov 's visit to china this time has given expression to acting president and concurrently premier vladimir vladimirovich putin 's great importance attached to sino - russian relations .
he asked klebanov to convey his cordial regards and good wishes to acting president and concurrently premier putin .
klebanov conveyed putin 's regards to zhu rongji .
he said that the purpose of his visit to china is to promote the continuous development of cooperation in various fields between the two countries .
he said that acting president and concurrently premier putin said on many occasions that russia resolutely stands for the establishment of a multi - polar world externally and the defense of state sovereignty and territorial integrity internally .
the development of strategic cooperative partnership between russia and china completely conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries .
russia is willing to strengthen close cooperation with china in the political , economic and international fields .
this year , the heads of state of china and russia will hold a meeting and the premiers of the two countries will also hold the fifth regular meeting .
we should comprehensively and seriously make preparation for such meetings now .
both sides should adopt measures to earnestly strengthen the material basis for relations between the two countries .
zhu rongji expressed agreement to klebanov 's viewpoints .
he said that the establishment and development of the sino - russian strategic cooperative partnership conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries , and will produce an important positive impact on maintaining global strategic stability and promoting peace and development of the world .
he said that during his visit to russia in february last year , the fourth regular meeting between the premiers of the two countries was held and a series of consensus on deepening and expanding cooperation between the two countries in economy , trade and high technology were reached .
in the past year since then , both sides have made considerable progress in implementing these agreements .
he emphasized that china thanks russia for its support to china 's principled stand on the taiwan issue and china will also unswervingly support russia 's efforts to safeguard national unification .
state councilor wu yi and state development planning commission minister zeng peiyan also attended the meeting .
prior to the meeting , wu yi and klebanov signed " minutes of talks " and officials responsible for relevant departments of the governments of the two countries signed an exchange of notes on russia 's providing nuclear fuel for china 's tianwan nuclear power station .
the members of fengnan city 's leading group said : the important speeches made by general secretary jiang zemin and other central leading comrades have rich ideological contents and deal with current realities .
we are determined to live up to the central leaders ' expectations and do a solid work in carrying out our " three stresses " education .
the members of yuhang city 's leading group said : the analyses made by general secretary jiang and other central leading comrades on the current situation and the party 's tasks are thorough . as soon as we heard them , we were suddenly enlightened .
the tasks of yuhang 's economic reform and development are quite heavy . we should handle well the system change and restructuring of enterprises , do a good job in importing , and make a good coordination to eliminate contradictions .
the central authorities are so concerned for us and devoting so much attention to us . we must make the " three stresses " education a success to lay a solid ideological foundation for reform and construction .
we must live up to the expectations of the party central committee and the people .
we should not always see only our achievements . we should also check whether we have not done what we should do .
we should sum up and make a list of those things that remain to be done .
the speeches of general secretary jiang and other central leading comrades have shaken us up a lot , enhanced our understanding of the great significance of stepping up party building and the building of spiritual civilization , and helped us overcome the mistake of " self - satisfaction . "
at the same time , they have solicited opinions from the general public and persistently engaged in study while correcting mistakes .
the report made by ye xuanping on behalf of the standing committee of the cppcc national committee is one of the major items on the agenda at today 's opening session .
he first reviewed the work of people 's political consultation in the past year .
he said the cppcc national committee has carried out consultation and discussion on important state affairs through holding plenary meetings of the committee , meetings of the standing committee and meetings of special committees .

after the " proposal " was submitted to the cpc central committee and the state council , it has attracted great attention of central leaders and relevant departments .
state - owned enterprises are the pillar of china 's national economy . properly carrying out the reform of state - owned enterprises is of extremely great importance to the establishment of the socialist market economy structure .

the pleasant and unexpected coincidence of " the year 2000 " and " 2,000 members " drew a warm round of applause in the great hall of 10,000 capacity .
a new century , a new millennium , and new hopes . these are the hottest topics discussed by members of the cppcc national committee before the opening ceremony .
developing western region - - hopes of new century member chen kaizhi of the macao special administrative region is one of those pursued by reporters .
speaking in fluent putonghua , he said the grand development of the western region would be a hot topic discussed at the " two sessions " this time .
he revealed that the proposal in which he participated concerns how china 's economically advanced coastal regions should play their due role in the grand development of the western region .
" we , members of the cppcc national committee , will even more actively participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs so as to jointly plan for the motherland 's wonderful future . "
" this is the time to develop the western region , " renowned economist and member dong fureng said .
" it will provide new development opportunities for the eastern region .
the grand development of the western region is a strategy of overall interest and will be " win - win " to both eastern and western regions . "
he proposed promoting a high - tech culture among tertiary institutions , imparting high - tech concepts to all lecturers , students , and staff , and helping them catch up with the great trend of a digitized economy and network - based society .
reducing students ' excessive workload and letting students develop in an all - round manner is also a topic of concern among the members .
member huang dawei , researcher at the animal research institute of the chinese academy of sciences , are working out a plan together with his colleagues to build a museum where kids can learn and play .
he said : " future society needs creative talents . only talents who can break new grounds can ensure china remains invincible in the new century . "
motherland 's reunification - - aspiration of entire nation wearing the blue uniform of a general , member feng lida was surrounded by a group of young servicemen who took pictures with her .
feng lida is the daughter of renowned patriotic general feng yuxiang .
she told this reporter that she would air her political view on the motherland 's reunification at the cppcc session .
she said that , following hong kong and macao 's return to the motherland , compatriots on the two sides of the strait , who share the same root , should advance toward the new century in a unified manner .

he said folks of the native place are greatly concerned about taiwan 's future .
he expressed his belief that the central authorities will definitely make wise policy decisions and the taiwan issue will definitely be resolved as early as possible .
in comparison with the five - year plans in the past , the 10th five - year plan shows many special characteristics .
therefore , when formulating the 10th five - year plan , we should take these special characteristics into full consideration , so that the plan can reflect and suit the special requirements of the new situation that china is to face in the future .
on the whole , the first two steps of china 's strategic target have been fulfilled ahead of schedule , at a level higher than the preset standards .
this marks the beginning of a new development phase in china 's social and economic development , that is , the phase of a gradual transition from a modest level of prosperity to modernization .
such a fact will inevitably give rise to many significant changes in china 's social and economic lives , for many contradictions and problems in a country 's social and economic lives are related to changes in its economic development .

premier zhu rongji and vice premier wu bangguo both gave important comments and instructions on the report .
rejuvenating the country through science and education and spiritual civilization were also important topics of proposals .
for example , the ministry of agriculture , ministry of science and technology , and ministry of finance regarded proposals on truly rejuvenating agriculture through science and technology as highly valuable , and will study and adopt relevant opinions and suggestions when formulating the agricultural technology development outline .
as a result , the ministry of education recently issued an urgent circular and made specific provisions .

strictly forbidden is the malpractice of handling " cases involving social connections , " " cases involving personal favors , " and " cases involving money . "
the third session of the ninth cppcc national committee opened here today . on behalf of the ninth cppcc national committee , ye xuanping reported on the work of the standing committee and put forward the outlines for the work of the cppcc this year .
on the need to make full use of the cppcc 's important role in expanding friendly exchanges with other countries , he said : we will positively and steadily develop friendly exchanges with other countries in accordance with the overall arrangements for china 's diplomatic work .
ye xuanping said that the cppcc national committee had energetically developed friendly exchanges with other countries and had played an important role in enlivening china 's diplomatic efforts , promoting understanding , friendship and cooperation between china and other countries during the past year .
during the past year , the cppcc national committee sent 18 delegations to visit 25 countries and received delegations or groups from seven countries . ''
he said : chairman li ruihuan paid successful goodwill visits to the republic of korea , the united arab emirates , oman , egypt , sri lanka , the maldives and japan .
nine vice chairmen headed delegations visiting countries in asia , europe , america and oceania or attending meetings of the international interaction council , the international association of economic and social councils and similar institutions as well as the davos world economic forum .
the exhibition was well received . the committee of foreign affairs issued a statement to lodge the strongest protest against the brutal us - led nato bombing of the chinese embassy in the federal republic of yugoslavia .
pan rixuan , professor of army building research institute under scientific research department of pla [ people 's liberation army ] national defense university , profoundly analyzed these issues during an interview .
professor pan rixuan said : speeding up army modernization is a need for fighting and winning a modern war which may break out , especially a local war under hi - tech conditions , and for safeguarding the motherland reunification and territorial integrity .
pan emphatically stated : the motherland reunification can not drag on indefinitely .
the history and reality have told us : on the road of fulfilling the complete reunification of the motherland , the struggle will be extremely formidable and demand more sufficient preparations .
the ancients said : " to stop a war with a war , the war shall succeed . "
the historical experiences have proven that peace can only be secured by " ability to fight " and peace is based on " ability to fight " only .
the extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .
how to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?
apparently , this pattern cannot meet the needs of leaving everything to the market at home and abroad after china 's wto entry .
second , the impact on agricultural product prices .
third , the impact on the agricultural production structure .
at present china 's agricultural products are far from meeting market consumption demand in terms of quality , variety , and structure .
if the agricultural structure is not restructured , the variety structure is not upgraded , and the quality of agricultural production is not improved as soon as possible , it will be very difficult for china 's agricultural products to enter the international market .
fourth , the impact of tariff concessions and non - tariff cuts on china 's agricultural product market .
china 's agricultural products have relied on import licenses , import quotas , and non - tariff measures for regulation and control for a long time .
after china enters the wto , the use of non - tariff measures will be banned , and china has to turn its existing non - tariff measures into relevant equivalent tariffs and cut them according to previously agreed stipulations .
the tariff concessions and the loss of non - tariff policy fiats will create favorable conditions for foreign agricultural products to occupy the chinese market on a large scale and thus impact china 's macro regulation and control efforts .
fifth , the agricultural marketization in china is not sound enough to meet the needs of the situation resulting from china 's entry into the wto .
although the resulting situation will be grim , the experts universally agreed : china 's wto will benefit both the country and the people .
kong xiangyun , associate professor of the economics institute of qighua university 's humanities college , maintained : china 's wto entry will bring about a lot of opportunities to agricultural production and agricultural product international trade .
in reality , this favorable factor is also the result of china 's effort to take the lead in carrying out rural reforms and a contracted responsibility system based on the household with remuneration linked to output .
the formation of china 's most dynamic , independent production and operation units is the root of china 's economic development and the base for china to face competition after it becomes a member of the wto .
moreover , china 's market system and foreign trade pattern have now taken shape initially .
the establishment of this three - layer market system means that china 's rural market system has taken shape initially and farmers have a base on which they get involved in the operation of both domestic and international markets .
in the face of tremendous challenges resulting from china 's wto entry , the experts proposed that the government actively cope with them and formulate a corresponding policy .
he said : the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland marked important progress made in the great cause of the motherland 's reunification .
the sacred mission of settling the taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland has become more outstanding before all the people of the country , including taiwan compatriots and overseas chinese .
it is necessary to seriously study and energetically explore new ways and methods for properly carrying out overseas solidarity work in the new situation and further promote great unity among the chinese at home and abroad .
in march , the spring breeze brings warmth to the people in beijing .
and , in the lounge on the rostrum of the great hall of the people , the fragrance of green tea wafted in the air , and narcissuses were in full bloom .
cppcc national leaders and members went down to grass - roots areas last year to conduct investigations and studies on the central work of the state and offered many valuable opinions and suggestions .
yang rudai and wan guoquan , vice chairmen of the cppcc national committee , sat together to talk about their investigation and study results .
vice chairman yang rudai , who has been concerned with agriculture for years , led some members to sichuan and gansu to investigate and study the situation in agricultural restructuring .
he said , investigations and studies are the foundation for cppcc members to participate in and discuss government affairs , therefore the work in this aspect should be intensified .
wan guoquan said the aging problem is a big problem for china that should arouse attention and be resolved as early as possible .
reportedly , the cppcc national committee conducted special investigations and studies on 43 issues last year and submitted 37 reports on these issues .
before the opening of the session , members warmly talked with one another in the east hall .
we must depend on the unity and struggle of the people of all nationalities to accelerate the development of western regions . "
just at this moment , chen hongduo , academician of the chinese academy of engineering , solemnly signed his name because he had long studied this issue and agreed with it .
he said : " it is cppcc members ' duty to investigate and study the conspicuous issues in economic and social activities and to offer advice and suggestions to relevant government departments . "
an information counter for the session was set up in the east hall equipped with an advanced computer search system .
member dong shilin from zhejiang university asked for statistical data from working staff and planned to bring them back to his lodging place for careful study .
member chen yu stood in front of the computer , searching and reading the data and figures concerning the counties below the poverty line .
this member , who used to work in qinghai and guizhou , said with a strong feeling : " this year is the last year to fulfill the seven - year poverty reduction plan , while the task remains very arduous .
i want to offer a suggestion on this issue during the current session .
checking some data here can make my suggestion more scientific and accurate . "
member sun xiaojiang , teacher of a primary school of jino nationality in xishuangbanna , said : " comrade jiang zemin 's speech on education issue is extremely important one that has deeply inspired educational workers .
in the effort to educate the younger generation , we cannot lay undue emphasis on scores , but should intensify the education on ideology and morality . we should not only impart knowledge but also educate students . "

governing the country according to law and building a country under the rule of the socialist legal system are a basic strategy set forth at the 15th cpc national congress for administering the country , which was of great concern to members of the cppcc national committee .
at its various meetings , members of the cppcc national committee positively spoken and made proposals on implementation of the strategy for governing the country according to law .

these proposals involved a wide range of issues concerning every aspect of the state and social life ; some of them reflected the situation , while others included countermeasures and proposals .
in the process of handling such proposals , we made a point of selecting some important proposals and urged the relevant authorities to address them , achieving very good results .
last year , the cppcc national committee reported more than 4,900 pieces of important views and proposals put forward by its members and of information on social conditions popular sentiments ; it received over 2,200 letters from the people .

we sternly refuted lee teng - hui 's [ li denghui 's ] " two - state " theory and strongly condemned the taiwan authorities for attempting to divide the motherland .

falungong has harmed so many people ! "
cppcc member he zuoxiu was besieged by reporters at the opening cppcc session today .
in response to the view of ms. robinson on the falungong matter , he said : this is not a human right regression , but rather progress . falungong has harmed so many , is still doing so , and ms. robinson is just too confused !
if the chinese government had not dealt with it , falungong would still be harming people . while we of course do not exclude the possibility that a few incidents may have been handled wrongly in the process , the overall decision was right .
he describes the current crackdown on pseudo - science thus : " while the situation is generally good , the mission will be heavy and protracted , " so we need to continue with exposures .
he zuoxiu said that he is today mainly proposing a bill recommending that the npc standing committee draft a " press oversight law . "
upon its publication , general secretary jiang zemin 's important speech delivered during his inspection in guangdong has evoked strong repercussions in china 's developed coastal areas .
today , an educational activity centering around the main theme of " always remembering where our wealth comes from and always remembering to make further progress after becoming better - off " is being carried out in an extensive and thoroughgoing way in china 's developed coastal areas .
li changchun , member of the political bureau of the cpc central committee and provincial party secretary of guangdong , indicated : in our efforts to " always remember where our wealth comes from , " we should know where the " source " of our wealth lies .
the " source " lies in deng xiaoping theory , the party 's basic line , and the correct leadership of the party central committee .
now that we have become better - off today , we should ask ourselves the question " where our wealth comes from " at all times .
in this development is embodied the painstaking work of the people of the entire country , including the people in poverty - stricken areas .
general secretary jiang 's important speech has enhanced the awareness of the vast numbers of cadres and masses for the overall situation and the overall interests of the country .
in such an important year , fuzhou is determined to grasp well its work in 10 aspects , including its economic structural readjustment , in a down - to - earth manner .
the city party committee of shenzhen stressed that shenzhen will take the overall situation into account and successfully carry out its work in all aspects by way of " creating new advantages , scaling new heights , and taking the lead in basically realizing socialist modernizations . "
general secretary jiang zemin 's speech delivered in guangdong has greatly aroused the enthusiasm of coastal areas in further participating in the large - scale development of the country 's western region .
shanghai has made its plan clear : never forgetting that shanghai belongs to the entire country , the city will play well the china card , and will do a good job in providing counterpart assistance and support for other regions .
relevant departments in zhejiang have already begun to organically integrate the educational activity of " always remembering where our wealth comes from and always remembering to make further progress after becoming better - off " with the province 's ongoing education on agricultural and rural modernizations .
beijing , 3 mar ( xinhua ) - - having been a municipality for just three years , chongqing will soon be involved in the large - scale development of the western region .
they propose that it is necessary to understand and arrange the work of the large - scale development of the western region with the interests of the whole in mind , with a sense of responsibility , in a reform spirit , and in consideration of strategic needs .
as a prelude to the strategy of large - scale development of the western region , the decision on turning chongqing into a municipality was made at a meeting of the first session of the ninth npc three years ago .
after three years of hard work , chongqing has made great achievements in all aspects of economic and social development and begun to enjoy the opportunity and benefits that only a few cities directly under the central government enjoy .
facing the great upsurge of the large - scale development of the western region , how should chongqing municipality seize this great opportunity ?
the remarks made by he guoqiang , npc deputy and secretary of the chongqing municipal cpc committee , are concise and comprehensive - - advocating cooperation , opposing exclusiveness and stepping up service .
he said : chongqing is a key link between the eastern region and the central western region , as well as a city with a very large amount of resources and comparatively adequate industrial support .
each of the provinces and autonomous regions in the western region has its strength . chongqing should not narrow - mindedly consider only its own development to fight for higher status and more authorized projects .
chongqing should resolutely participate in and support any projects so long as they can greatly promote the development of the western region , even if they are of little benefit to chongqing .
we should keep a clear head and must not make any strategic mistake again .
in development , the western region should strive to learn from the eastern region and from the experience of developed countries .
one is to make a new breakthrough in the management systems by fine - tuning the municipal administrative system and economic regulation and control system , adapting them to chongqing 's actual conditions and making them highly efficient .
it has been learned that jiang zemin 's speeches made during his inspection tour of guangdong in the south from 21 to 25 february are being relayed to cpc members and cadres at various levels in guangdong .
according to a relevant source , jiang zemin 's speeches made during his inspection tour of guangdong in the south this time have very rich contents and evidently , he had made preparation before he came .
jiang zemin also said that the cpc and the chinese government has never compromised in the least on such a major issue of principle of safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity , and it is absolutely impossible for any attempt to split up china to succeed .
the third session of the ninth cppcc national committee opened in beijing yesterday ; the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] will open tomorrow .
more than 5,000 npc deputies and cppcc members gathering in beijing from all quarters to attend the two sessions in this early spring is a major annual event in china 's political life .
china had more major events , more difficult problems , and more surprise incidents last year .
the chinese government has stood all kinds of rigorous tests in the complicated changing situation and scored remarkable achievements in the political , economic , social , science and technology , cultural , and diplomatic fields .
the taiwan issue is a major issue of concern to all chinese people .
in the wake of the reversion of hong kong and macao , china 's complete reunification has become the chinese nation 's principal mission in the new century .
last july , the motherland launched a resolute struggle against lee teng - hui 's [ li denghui ] " two states theory , " and the struggle has led to in the theory 's complete bankruptcy .
it is expected that during the two sessions , npc deputies and cppcc members will express their views on this issue and will pool their wisdom and efforts to push forward the great cause of china 's reunification .
this is a strategic shift in china 's economic construction .
like what it has done in the past when it actively participated in the development of the eastern coastal region , hong kong 's business community can also find new development opportunities if it invests in the western region . china is expected to join the wto this year .
it will have a far - reaching impact on china in all fields .
during the two sessions , many npc deputies and cppcc members will make proposals and suggestions on relevant policies .
it is expected that the two sessions will help create greater consensus on china 's accession to the wto and help china better prepared for its entry .
state council leaders and heads of the various commissions , ministries , and departments will listen carefully to the views of npc deputies and cppcc members on improving administrative efficiency and standards .
this year , the macao special administrative region [ sar ] formed a npc delegation to attend the npc session for the first time . the delegation received warm welcome from other delegations . it is another song of triumph for the great solidarity of the chinese nation .
we wish the two sessions complete success .
notes on starting the column this year 's " two sessions " were held in an important period at the turn of the century .
with enthusiasm and a firm conviction , delegates reviewed and summarized the course of our struggle and the achievements we had attained . looking forward to the 21st century , they were full of pride and eager to make progress .
this shows that the party has a completely mature understanding of this scientific theory and upheld the theory more conscientiously , clearheadedly , and firmly .
china 's basic rural changes are attributable to the correct guidance of deng xiaoping theory and to the firm leadership of the third - generation leading core .
zhulin has developed from a hillside village short of water and food into a modern town with all kinds of functions . its people , who had worked as farmers for generations , have become town dwellers who created and enjoyed modern civilization .
farmers thank deng xiaoping at heart and considered deng xiaoping theory the most useful theory of contemporary china that has brought tangible benefits to them .
without such conscientiousness and staunchness , the reform and development of state enterprises are out of the question .
the people of handan deeply feel that to have a new outlook in the new century , handan cannot depart at any moment from deng xiaoping theory .
this theory achieved tremendous success in the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland .
the fact that hong kong has enjoyed economic prosperity and social stability and that its people have lived in peace and contentment since its reversion two years ago has proved and will continue to prove the greatness and correctness of the theory .
currently , i have seven enterprises on the motherland with the first one established in shanghai in 1985 .
the successful founding of these enterprises is attributable to the great initiative of " one country , two systems . "
the great concept is the great initiative for the ultimate accomplishment of the reunification of the motherland . it is not only scientific but is the sole theory .
i believe that under the guidance of deng xiaoping theory , the taiwan issue will be correctly resolved . a unified and powerful china surely will stand like a giant in the new century .
it is also the common aspiration of all chinese people , including the taiwan compatriots .
zeng jianhui said : we hope that the taiwan authorities will not run against the historical trend and will not create obstacles to the development of cross - strait relations and reunification of the motherland .
we will never sit idle by when confronted with any attempt to split the motherland and promote " taiwan independence . "
we hope that the two sides across the taiwan strait conduct dialogue and negotiations based on the principle of " one china " and develop healthy cross - strait relations .
jiang zemin stressed that : hong kong and macao have both returned to the embrace of the motherland .
this was a crucial victory on our path to complete national reunification .
so a final solution to the taiwan problem , to achieve our complete national reunification , has become a more pressing aspiration and demand of the chinese people .
the chinese government and people have the confidence and ability to solve the taiwan problem soon , to complete our great cause of national reunification .
since we cross - strait compatriots are like brothers , we should together endeavor to achieve an early complete national reunification .
at the joint session , the committee members gave their views on matters such as national reunification , cppcc work , cross - strait economic and trade ties after wto membership , the grand development of western china , and taiwan investment .
chinese kmt central committee standing committee member and gansu province people 's political consultative conference vice chairman deng chengcheng noted that faster environment building and infrastructure construction are the grounds and basis for the grand development of western china .
jiang zemin listened and took notes , joining in at times on certain matters and joint debates by committee members .
upon hearing statements by committee members , jiang zemin spoke .
he extended cordial greetings and best wishes to all committee members and to the masses of taiwan compatriots through the committee members .
the white paper that we issued recently on " the one - china principle and the taiwan problem " fully expresses our firm position on insisting on the one - china principle .
since peaceful reunification will be favorable to our taiwan compatriots and the whole chinese people , and favorable to the peace and development of the asia - pacific region and even the world , it will be the best way to solve the taiwan problem .
in the basic interests of our cross - strait compatriots , we are making the greatest efforts , doing all possible to solve the taiwan problem peacefully .
of course , the prerequisite is that we must adhere to the one - china principle .
but we will absolutely not promise to renounce the use of force .
this is our consistent stand .
the chinese people have never feared ghosts or believed in evil spirits , and we will all firmly oppose sinister actions that would endanger the basic interests of the chinese nation .
jiang zemin noted that the taiwan people have a glorious tradition of patriotism .
thus , we are continuing as always to place our wholehearted hopes on the taiwan people .
we believe that , as to major matters of principle involving national sovereignty and territorial integrity , the basic interests of the chinese nation , and the future and fate of taiwan , our taiwan compatriots will definitely make the right choice .
i want to take this opportunity to solemnly state again that we fully respect the aspirations of the taiwan people to be the masters of their own affairs and their economic development , defending the vital interests of our taiwan compatriots .
we urge our taiwan compatriots to fully understand and correctly interpret our principles and policies on taiwan , intensifying their understanding of their native mainland china , to create favorable terms for an early solution of the taiwan problem .
jiang zemin said : all of you cppcc members have done much outstanding work to help the party and government implement our taiwan principles and policies , uniting our taiwan compatriots both in china and abroad .
we hope that you will continue your efforts , to make a new contribution to promoting cross - strait personnel intercourse , economic and cultural interaction , and an early solution of the taiwan problem .
the party committee and government at all levels need to firmly implement all party and government principles , policies , and laws on our taiwan compatriots , to defend their legal rights and interests .
we firmly believe that , through the joint efforts of all chinese , including our taiwan compatriots , our compete national reunification will definitely be achieved .
the discussion was chaired by cppcc vice chairman and chinese kmt central committee permanent vice chairman zhou tienong .
figures such as npc standing committee vice chairman and chinese kmt central committee chairman he luli , cppcc vice chairmen ye xuanping and wang zhaoguo , and cppcc vice chairman and taiwan democratic self government league central committee chairman zhang kehui took part in the discussion .
this remark made zhu rongji and other participating members laugh .

during the discussion , zhu rongji said : we have members from hong kong , do we not ?

zhu rongji consented to some of their views , saying that the central authorities are always in support of hong kong 's efforts to maintain its status as an international financial center .
he expressed hope that hong kong 's economy can recover in all aspects as soon as possible ; and he also believed that hong kong will have a more magnificent prospect as a result of china 's upcoming accession to the wto .
' i dared to offend you because you are my fellow townsman ' [ subhead ] in view that too many people wished to speak at the meeting , those members who got a chance to speak were asked to make their points as brief and clear as possible .
however , member li juewen , director of the sanxiang group company ltd . , failed to come to the point long after he started to talk .
seeing this , zhu rongji interrupted and said : my fellow townsman , you had better go directly to substantive issues now .
later , zhu rongji apologized to li juewen : i was a bit impolite just now . i ask for you understanding , for i was too eager to hear your substantive opinions next .
i would not have made such a rash act if you were not my fellow townsman . i dared to offend you because you are my fellow townsman .
' i have an opportunity to speak tomorrow ' [ subhead ] at today 's meeting , 17 members aired their views and made suggestions on issues concerning the rural economy , state enterprise reform , the development of the western region , and increases in salary .
zhu rongji listened to them attentively , taking notes from time to time .

zhang zhaozhong , noted military theoretician and professor at the national defense university , is of the view that peaceful reunification is the guiding principle on the resolution of the taiwan issue .
unless taiwan breaches the three " ifs " outlined in the white paper , and the mainland cannot but use force against it , the current favorable situation should not be lightly undermined .
" junshi bolan bao " published here today an exclusive interview with zhang zhaozhong regarding the taiwan issue .
this will be a local war under high - tech conditions , and our whole nation is likely to be mobilized for national defense . in this battle , the state may shift its focus from economic construction to winning the war .
professor zhang added : i think peaceful reunification is the guiding principle on the resettlement of the taiwan issue . eaceful reunification and one country , two systems is what deng xiaoping entrusted to us .
as taiwan 's presidential elections are to be held soon , we can still wait patiently to see if a better opportunity will come .
for the first 30 years of the 50 years after new china was founded , the mainland was preparing for war . only for the remaining 20 years did it launch reform and opening up , as well as economic construction .
our country has become increasingly prosperous and its comprehensive national strengthen has been enhanced significantly .
therefore , we should continue to uphold the strategy centering on economic construction . unless taiwan breaches the three " ifs " outlined in the white paper , and the mainland cannot but use force against it , the present favorable situation should not be lightly undermined .
policy decisions on war or peace , as well as on fighting the war early or later , should be made from the national strategic perspective and from a viewpoint of national economic construction as a whole .
the state should not consider making war for the sake of war .

through election , zhang wannian acts as the head of the delegation , and chi haotian and yu yongbo act as the deputy heads of the delegation .
zhang wannian made a speech at a meeting to mark the formation of the delegation yesterday .
he said that being npc deputies , it is necessary to be clear about our historical responsibility and to enthusiastically put forward proposals and strategies for the modernization of the country and the armed forces .
it is necessary to enhance the sense of the overall situation and focus our thinking on the overall situation .
it has been learned that the pla delegation to the third session of the ninth npc numbers 267 people and the delegation is divided into eight groups for various activities .
this morning , li lanqing came to the 21st century hotel in beijing to attend the joint meeting for the members of the cppcc national committee from the educational circles .
li lanqing indicated : in the new century , the higher education in china is faced with severe challenges and extraordinary opportunities .
he disclosed that a general principle on a two - level running of schools will be established in this year 's program for the reform and development of higher education .
after the members aired their views , which took a whole hour , a smiling li lanqing said : i know it is my turn to speak ; in fact , i also feel the great urge to talk .
the student answered : " the school has opened a ' si - pin ' course for us . "
li did not understand : " a ' shi bing [ dried persimmon ] ' course ? "
answer : " no , it is an educational course on ideology and morality . "
li asked again : " what is taught in the course then ? "
answer : " mathematics . "
when talking about the issue as how education can support the development of the country 's western region , li lanqing said : elementary education is of utmost importance .
the country 's eastern region can consider to provide counterpart support to the western region by sending them both exchange teachers and teaching equipment . we should have the determination to enhance the level of elementary education in china 's western region .
at the meeting , li lanqing also exchanged views with the members on such issues as vocational education , network education , and civilian - run education .
but the position portrayed in the ongoing tv series " chinese army " shows that china 's leaders and the chinese government will absolutely not soften their stance at all on the matter of any form of " taiwan independence . "
there is plenty of proof to show that : the chinese government has firm contingency steps and strategic and tactical plans for any " contingency " in taiwan 's future .
any " taiwan independence " plot will be nothing but a case of " an egg breaking on the rocks . "
the report says that : since the impressive martial display of the 1999 [ national day ] parade , why is the display continuing through the tv series " chinese army ? "
an official military source says that the 1999 parade showed a static exterior view of the weaponry , while the " chinese army " shows its real combat effectiveness integrating man with machine .
so it is undoubtedly an empirical interpretation of the " resolve and capability to defend national reunification " that the chinese army has repeatedly declared .
since the tv series " chinese army " has been showing , it is believed that a so - called " armed threat theory " will steadily appear .
in which respect , a beijing taiwan expert notes that on basic matters involving national sovereignty and reunification , there is no issue of threat versus no threat , because the armed forces per se are a deterrent force to defend national security .
the " chinese army " is a show for sensible people . if certain diehard " taiwan independence " figures do not understand , they are fooling either themselves , the voters , or the common people .
" qiao bao " is acting in line with the 15 - part tv series " chinese army " to specially run 10 exclusive issues on " a sharp display of china 's military might . "
the first one today has graphics and text comprehensively introducing the march of the chinese army into the 21st century .
the new york " ming bao " and " shijie ribao " are carrying news today on the cctv " chinese army " issued by " zhongyang she . "
" shijie ribao " stresses that " the scenes of various exercises shown at the opening of the cppcc to taiwan on the eve of its general election will have a strong visual impact . "

he also held that to develop high - tech industries in our country , it is necessary to study and use for reference the systems and policies to promote science and technology renovation in foreign countries .

besides , the government should also provide help and support .
committee member cai jiming suggested that the state should include extra - budgetary funds in budgets for management and strengthen supervision on the use of financial funds .
how to do a good job in the general development of the western region was a major topic in the speeches of the committee members .

committee member wang chaobin suggested that in developing the western region , it is necessary to pay attention to improving the overall quality of local leading cadres .
while listening to the speakers , zhu rongji seriously made notes .
when he discovered committee members from hong kong had not yet made any speech , he said with special concern : " let committee members from hong kong have some time to air their views . "
with the premier 's " special concern , " tian beijun , zhuang qicheng , lu zonglin , and other committee members from hong kong spoke at the meeting one after another .

beijing , 4 mar ( xinhua ) - - an important speech made by general secretary jiang zemin during his inspection of guangdong has evoked strong , nationwide repercussions .

we should take the " three stresses " education as a turning point , vigorously perform our work in various fields , and promote economic development and social stability throughout the county .
the important speech made by general secretary jiang in guangdong has inspired cadres at various levels in various localities .
through mobilization , education , and guidance , however , the masses put forward 217 suggestions and views for the county leading body and 520 suggestions and views for individual leading cadres .
those suggestions and views shook up the leading body , which realized that there were still many problems to be solved and that vigorous efforts should be made to solve ideological problems and problems of mentality among leading cadres .
party organizations at various levels throughout the country have been conscientiously studying the spirit of the speech made by general secretary jiang zemin in guangdong and taking the " three stresses " education as a driving force for improving the style of work and economic work .
cadres throughout the county will firmly seize the opportunity offered by the large - scale development of the western region and , in an ever more positive spirit , lead the people of various nationalities in the county in shaking off poverty and getting better - off .
sun changxiong , director of the harbin city commission for the reform of the economic structure , said : to effectively conduct the " three stresses " education , emphasis should be laid on " one key " and " on core . "

yin guangli , secretary of the funan county cpc committee in anhui , held : effectively conducting the " three stresses " education will be an important sign of doing a good job in this regard across the country .
if the conduct of " three stresses " education at the county level failed , it would be impossible to carry out rectification and reform measures at the provincial level .
li peng pointed out : to implement the principle of governing the country by law , we must first step up legislative work and establish and improve china 's socialist legal system .
legislation should serve the central work of the nation and should be integrated with major reform policies and policies aimed at speeding up economic development and ensuring social stability .
legislation is one of the npc 's major tasks and responsibilities . the npc has a clear legislation goal .
it is of major practical significance and far - reaching historical significance . through two decades of reforms and opening up , china 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .
this will increase the eastern region 's support of the western region .
in doing all this , it is necessary to proceed from reality and suit measures to local conditions .
li peng also stressed the need to accelerate the development of infrastructure in the western region .
li peng made a special point of discussing the question of combating corruption . he said : fellow cppcc members have just given us their good suggestions .
the people are deeply resentful of the spread of corruption .
we must set up a sound system and related mechanisms and intensify our efforts to punish corrupt officials .
speaking of china 's accession to the wto , li peng pointed out : the multipolarization of the world , the economic globalization , and the rapid advance of science and technology have brought risks and rigorous challenge as well as rare development opportunities to the chinese nation .
the npc must step up efforts to draft , enact , and revise relevant laws to keep up with the new situation following china 's accession to the wto .
at the joint cdl and cdnca group discussion , cppcc members from different regions and professions took the floor one after another to express their views on a wide range of issues .

bearing with them the hopes and trust of the 1.2 billion people , nearly 3,000 npc deputies from various parts of the motherland gathered in beijing to attend the third session of the ninth npc being held here .
this is a conference held at the important moment of the turn of the century and the millennium .
this major event in the political life of the people of all nationalities in china will have an important meaning in china 's reform , development and stability .
we warmly hail the convocation of this session .
the advance from 1999 and 2000 marked a major turning point , an important opportunity for development .
as the new century is just round the corner , the achievements and experiences of the past year and the situation and tasks of the new year become even more special as a link between the past and the future .
in the past year , we upheld the party 's basic line , fully implemented the policy of expanding domestic demand , actively promoted various reforms , met the anticipated economic growth targets , and achieved new successes in various undertakings .
we victoriously carried out three political struggles , thus creating a fine political environment for concentrating our energies on economic construction .
since this year is the final year in meeting the important targets before the end of the this century , the tasks of deepening the reforms , promoting development , safeguarding stability and strengthening ideological and political work are very arduous .
doing this year 's work well means a lot to the realization of china 's cross - century development targets .
in his spring festival greetings to the people of all nationalities in china and all ethic and oversea chinese abroad , comrade jiang zemin wished " prosperity , richness and strength for the motherland and happiness and good health for the people . "
these well - meant words of greetings reflect the aspirations of the sons and daughters of the chinese nation , express the strong will of the chinese nation to achieve its great rejuvenation , and represent the long - cherished ideal of the chinese people .
it is the best form of political organization for the people to become their own masters .
with the development of reform , opening up and socialist modernization , the system of people 's congresses will become more perfect and will play an increasingly important role .
emancipating the mind , seeking truth from facts , and creatively unfolding work within the scope of the constitution and the laws will be of great importance in further bringing into play the superiority and role of the system of people 's congresses .
the interests of the motherland are above everything else , and the interests of the people are above everything else .
at all times and under all circumstances , the starting and goal in all our work must be in the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people .
comrade jiang zemin pointed out during his recent inspection in guangdong : success in running things well in china hinges on our party .
economic foundation determines superstructure . among the aforementioned " three representatives , " the most important is that the party should always remain the representative of the development demands of advanced productive forces .
this is exactly where the mission and the life of communists lies .
these are the essential factors leading to the emergence of communists , and also to the inexorable victory of the socialist system .
they also serve as the fundamental reasons for the birth , growth , and victory of the cpc ; and for the strong vitality of our great undertaking of building socialism with chinese characteristics .
the key to whether we can represent the development demands of advanced productive forces lies in whether we can regard the masses of the people as the main force for pushing forward the development of history , and lies in whether production relations suit the development of productive forces .
all the hard efforts we have made in reform and opening up over the past 20 - plus years are all aimed at readjusting productive relations , and at opening up a new road , for the liberation and development of the country 's productive forces .
to represent the development demands of advanced productive forces , we should center around the country 's economic construction , and concentrate our energy on developing productive forces .
therefore , we must remove all interruptions , and concentrate our efforts on accelerating the development of productive forces .
science and technology are primary productive forces .
to the development demands of advanced productive forces , we should attach great importance to promoting scientific and technological innovations , to bringing up scientific and technological talents , and to stepping up the development of the scientific and technological undertaking .
we should take active steps to push forward the building of a knowledge innovation system in the country , and concentrate our attention and energy on making breakthroughs in a number of fields which are playing a major leading role in the country 's economic and social development .
jiang zemin pointed out : after their return to the motherland , both hong kong and macao have entered a new period of historical development .
jiang zemin stressed : it is the common desire of the people of all nationalities throughout the country to maintain the long - term prosperity , stability , and development of hong kong and macao .
we should support and do all things that are conducive to maintaining the prosperity , stability , and development of hong kong and macao , and we should oppose and stop anything that is detrimental to their prosperity , stability , and development .
jiang zemin and li ruihuan participated in a joint meeting held by members of the cppcc national committee from hong kong and macao and heard their speeches at the meeting .
it is necessary to do a good job in ideological education and to strengthen supervision by public opinion so as to promote reform and opening up , combat corruption , and encourage integrity .

he first briefed the members of the cppcc national committee on the situation in our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization drive .
referring to hong kong , jiang zemin said : when i met with you here on 4 march last year , hong kong 's economy had yet to be eased up from the impact of the asian financial crisis .
this is why i then hoped that you would keep up your spirits and tide over the difficulties together .
today we meet again , but the situation is quite different .
under the leadership of the government of the hong kong special administrative region headed by mr. tung chee - hwa , large numbers of hong kong compatriots have worked together with one heart so that hong kong 's economy is recovered , and its social stability maintained .
the government of the hong kong special administrative region has been gaining more and more administrative experiences .
the central government is very much gratified at this situation .
we said before that the great socialist motherland is always a strong backing for hong kong and macao to maintain prosperity and stability and to overcome difficulties and dangers on their road of advance .
with the passage of time , hong kong and macao will more and more deeply realize this point .
the practice of hong kong in the past two - odd years since its return to the motherland shows that the concept of " one country , two systems " is all correct and that hong kong people running hong kong with a high degree of autonomy is feasible .
referring to macao , jiang zemin pointed out : macao smoothly returned to the motherland on 20 december last year .
i saw with my own eyes the elatedness and jubilation with which macao compatriots celebrated their return to the motherland , and this is hardly forgettable to me .
we believe that the future of macao will be bright and beautiful .
qian qichen , member of the cpc central committee political bureau and vice premier of the state council , participated in the joint meeting .
huo ying - tung [ huo yingdong ] , vice chairman of the cppcc national committee , chaired the joint meeting , which ye xuanping , wang zhaoguo , and ma wanqi , vice chairmen of the cppcc national committee , also attended .
jiang zemin stressed : hong kong and macao have already returned to the embrace of the motherland .
this is a signal victory we have won on our road to realizing the reunification of the motherland .
finally settling the taiwan issue to realize the complete reunification of the motherland has become an ever more urgent wish and demand of all chinese people .
the chinese government and people have the confidence and ability to solve the taiwan issue at an early date and to accomplish the great cause of reunifying the motherland .
compatriots on both sides of the taiwan strait , with brotherly love for each other , should make joint efforts to realize the complete reunification of the motherland at an early date .
jiang zemin took notes while hearing their speeches ; he also interposed a remark or two from time to time .
after hearing their speeches , jiang zemin delivered a speech .
he extended his cordial regards and best wishes to the members of the cppcc national committee and , through them , to the taiwan compatriots .
lately , we issued the white paper entitled " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue , " in which we fully expressed our firm stand in upholding the one - china principle .
peaceful reunification is in the interests of the taiwan compatriots and all chinese people , and it is conducive to peace and development in the asia - pacific region and even the world ; this is the best way to solve the taiwan issue .
for the interests of the compatriots on both sides of the taiwan strait , we will make the greatest possible efforts and do everything possible to settle the taiwan issue by peaceful means .
of course , the prerequisite is to uphold the one - china principle .
but we will never renounce the use of force .
this is also our consistent stand .
the chinese people are never afraid of ghosts , nor do they believe in heresy , and we are firmly opposed to any ghosts or heresies harming the fundamental interests of the chinese nation .
jiang zemin pointed out : the taiwan compatriots have a glorious patriotic tradition .
we consistently and wholeheartedly place hopes on the taiwan people .
we are convinced that the taiwan compatriots will make their correct choice on this major issue of right and wrong concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country , the fundamental interests of the chinese nation , and the future and destiny of the taiwan compatriots .
i like to take this opportunity to solemnly state once again that we fully respect the taiwan compatriots ' desire to be the masters of their own affairs and their demand for economic development and will safeguard their vital interests .
it is necessary to promote a comprehensive and accurate understanding of our principles and policies toward taiwan among the taiwan compatriots and to enhance their understanding of the mainland of the motherland so that favorable conditions will be created for solving the taiwan issue at an early date .
jiang zemin said : the members of the cppcc national committee who are present here have done a great deal of fruitful work in assisting the party and the government in carrying out the principles and policies toward taiwan and uniting taiwan compatriots at home and abroad .
i hope that you will continue working hard to promote the exchange of visits by personnel on both sides of the taiwan strait as well as economic and cultural exchanges and contribute to the early solution of the taiwan issue .
party committees and governments at all levels should firmly implement the party and the state 's principles , policies , and laws concerning the taiwan compatriots and safeguard their legitimate rights and interests .
we are firmly believe that the complete reunification of the motherland can certainly be realized through the joint efforts of all chinese , including the taiwan compatriots .

in doing literary and art work , we should adhere to the policy of " letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend " and take effective measures to promote the thriving of literary and artistic creation .
also , we should absorb results of other nations ' advanced civilizations ; by learning from others ' strong points to make up our deficiencies , we will be able to bring about ever greater literary and art prosperity .
song jian , qian zhengying , luo haocai , and wang wenyuan , vice chairmen of the cppcc national committee , and responsible officials of relevant departments attended today 's joint meetings .
in face of the new century , we should hold still higher the great banner of deng xiaoping theory , firm up our faith in the ideal of socialism with chinese characteristics , and victoriously stride into the new century .
in the past few days , the deputies in our delegation have been thinking over what are the " sources " of the rapid economic development in fujian .
over the past 20 - odd years , earthshaking changes have taken place in fujian 's economic and social appearances with the aggregate quantity of the economy continuously increasing .
reporter jiang wei reported from the jiangxi npc delegation : deputy wen xinhua said : talking about strengthening the conviction of socialism with chinese characteristics , we people from the old liberated areas are best qualified to speak on this subject .
the party 's third generation of leading collective with comrade jiang zemin at the core has held aloft the banner of deng xiaoping theory and led us from victory to victory .
in the final analysis , the party 's basic theory and basic line have conformed to the will and common aspirations of the people .
the earthshaking changes have enabled the people in the old liberated areas to profoundly cherish in their hearts the conviction of steadfastly following the road of socialism with chinese characteristics .
reporter liu ruijia reported from the group of scientific and technological circles of the chinese people 's political consultative conference (cppcc) : the cppcc members had deep feelings when they talked about their faith in the ideal of socialism with chinese characteristics .
member jin zongzhe said that international competition is ever more vehement after the arrival of the new century .
in a bid to narrow the gap between the western developed countries and ourselves , it is imperative to vigorously develop our economy , quietly immerse ourselves in hard work , and firmly grasp the center of economic construction .
when the economy makes advances , and the lives of the masses are increasingly better off , then their confidence in the ideal of socialism with chinese characteristics will be further strengthened .
deputy wang guangxian said : the promotion of hainan to a provincial status and as a special economic zone was a significant move personally initiated by comrade deng xiaoping , which is a major indication of faster economic development , deeper reform , and wider opening up in china .
without this , we could not have everything that we have today .
trade unions should strengthen themselves in the spirit of reform .
workers and staff members should be organized to conduct extensive labor emulation , to make rationalization proposals and technological innovations , and to carry out other economic and technological - innovation activities .
in view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in - depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .
all such work is set according to the nature and tasks of the trade unions , which meets the requirements for safeguarding the overall interests of the people across the country and for safeguarding the specific interests of the workers and staff members .
to prevent infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of workers and staff members and effectively perform this work , trade unions must be good at mobilizing and organizing workers and staff members to do a good job in democratic supervision .
comrade deng xiaoping warned us long ago that it is necessary to have a mass supervision system and to let the masses and party members supervise the cadres , especially the leading cadres .
comrade jiang zemin also repeatedly required us to widen the supervision channels and give full play to the supervisory role of the masses of people .
organizing workers and staff members to exercise democratic supervision is a right entrusted to the trade unions by the law .
to properly exercising this right , it is necessary to do the following : 1 . supervision should be exercised according to law .
supervision should be exercised in various ways and through various channels .
actual results should be achieved in democratic supervision .
efforts should be made to strengthen effective supervision mechanisms to restrain the acts of infringing on the democratic - supervision right of workers and staff members .
members of the cppcc national committee from trade unions and from among the returned overseas chinese enthusiastically spoke at the discussion .
it is necessary to strengthen the consolidation or rebuilding of such organizations and to make new breakthroughs in reemployment and in safeguarding the rights and interests of workers and staff members .
dong jingwei , li yuguang , hou xuyu , wu mengzhao , zhou bingde , and liu minsheng , members of the cppcc national committee , also spoke at the discussion .
li guixian , zhu guangya , and mao zhiyong , vice chairmen of the cppcc national committee , also participated in the discussion held by members of the cppcc national committee from trade unions and from among the returned overseas chinese .
zeng jianhui said : the current session will examine a draft legislative law .
the law aims at further standardizing legislative activities and formulating concrete , clear - cut , and unified laws and provisions on some important issues concerning legislative activities , so as to safeguard unification of the state legal system .
he briefed the reporters on key contents of this draft law .
he said that , focusing on establishing a socialist market economic system , the current npc and its standing committee formulated a number of laws and law - related decisions , such as the contract law , securities law , public bidding law , sole - proprietor enterprise law .
on strengthening supervision , zeng jianhui said : the ninth npc and its standing committee have intensified their supervision efforts over the past year .
this aspect of work can be summed up with the words " three , four , and five . "
responding to reporters ' questions , zeng jianhui also indicated that the npc and its standing committee have all along attached great importance to anti - corruption work and has worked hard to legislate anti - corruption efforts by beginning with perfecting the legal system .
he said that , over the past year , the npc standing committee has made definite progress in its supervision work and has accumulated experiences for formulation of the supervision law .
based on individual decisions and laws on supervision work , the npc standing committee will sum up practical experiences and make earnest efforts to draft the supervision law .
zeng jianhui spoke to reporters about the above issues at a news conference held at the great hall of the people this morning .
he briefed reporters on the preparatory meeting for the third session of the ninth npc and the first meeting of the session 's presidium held after the preparatory meeting , which has just ended .
he said : in his government work report , premier zhu rongji fully affirmed the tremendous achievements china scored last year in reform and opening up and modernization and clearly set forth the targets , tasks , and guidelines of the government 's work for this year .
zhang wannian said : bringing about total reunification of the motherland is a common will and wish of all chinese people , including taiwan compatriots .
since hong kong 's and macao 's reversion to the motherland , settling the taiwan issue to finally accomplish the motherland 's reunification has more prominently lain in front of us .
the taiwan issue is one left by china 's civil war in this century . the world recognizes that there is only one china , and taiwan is a part of china .
over the years , we have adhered to the principle of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems , " forcefully promoting development of cross - strait relations and laying an important foundation for accomplishing the great cause of motherland 's reunification .
what calls for our vigilance is that the splittist forces in taiwan have insisted on doing things their way , tried to strengthen their hands with foreign forces , confused and poisoned people 's minds , and gone further on the road of splitting the motherland .
some foreign forces unwilling to see china 's reunification also have further intervened in the taiwan issue in an attempt to hamper the process of china 's reunification .
zhang wannian solemnly and justly pointed out : the pla is a great wall of steel for defending the motherland , and it shoulders the sacred duty of ensuring china 's national security and territorial integrity and the motherland 's reunification .
the constitution and law stipulate that ensuring the motherland 's reunification and opposing splittism are the sacred mission of the people 's army .
in the process of settling the taiwan issue , we will do whatever we can to bring about peaceful reunification .
this is our long - held stand .
the chinese pla completely has the resolve , confidence , ability , and way to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity , and by no means will tolerate and sit by idly watching any plot to split the motherland succeed .
peaceful reunification between taiwan and the mother mainland is in line with the fundamental interests of compatriots on the two sides of the strait and of the chinese nation .
the two sides of the strait must not remain separated forever and the taiwan issue must not drag on indefinitely .
" taiwan independence " means a war and splittism will preclude peace .
we also believe that the large number of taiwan compatriots , including officers and men of taiwan 's military , will make a wise choice at a moment affecting china 's overall national interest and their own fates .
facing the new century , the pla is shouldering heavy tasks .
we firmly believe that , under the strong leadership of the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin at its core , and with common efforts of all chinese people , including taiwan compatriots and overseas chinese , the motherland 's total reunification definitely can be achieved .
beijing , 5 mar (zxs) - - jiefangjun bao will publish tomorrow a commentator 's article , entitled " ' taiwan independence ' means war . "
the article says the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " published by the chinese government has evoked strong repercussions at home and abroad .
the government work report made by premier zhu rongji at the third session of the ninth national people 's congress has further expounded the chinese government 's consistent stand on settling the taiwan issue .
our people 's armed forces will undertake better the sacred mission of safeguarding the motherland 's unification in accordance with the requirements of the party central committee and the cmc .
the article points out that since the return of hong kong and macao one after the other to the motherland , the great cause of promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland has entered a new historical stage .
putting an end to the situation of the separation of the two sides of the strait at an early date and realizing complete reunification of the motherland is where the fundamental interests of the chinese nation lies , and is an irresistible historical trend .
because of this , the cpc and the chinese government have shown the greatest sincerity and made the greatest efforts to strive for the realization of peaceful reunification in accordance with the " one country , two system " principle .
the " constitutional white paper " published not long ago is in essence a " taiwan independence declaration . "
we must never be misled by his sweet words .
besides , we have consistently opposed foreign forces ' meddling in the taiwan issue and opposed the attempts of some people in the us congress to sell advanced weapons to taiwan under all kinds of pretexts and by means of concocting the " taiwan security enhancement act . "
however , this principle is based on the principle of adhering to the one - china principle , which is also the prerequisite of the former .
we have the greatest sincerity to realize peaceful reunification , and will do all we can and make the greatest efforts to strive for peaceful reunification .
however , we must explicitly point out : " taiwan independence " means war and splitting up cannot result in peace .
this is because " taiwan independence " and a split will only undermine china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , will only split taiwan from the motherland , and will only make it impossible to have peaceful reunification of the motherland .
creating a split and seeking independence under whatever name and in whatever way by the " taiwan independence " and splittist forces is the most serious provocation against china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
this is a very dangerous act of playing with fire that no chinese will find acceptable .
realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is in the highest interest of the country and the nation , is the firm and unshakable will of all the chinese people , and is a great goal that can never be changed .
on this major issue of principle on which the future and destiny of the chinese nation hinge , there is no room for compromise at all .
we entirely have the determination , confidence , ability and ways to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity , and will never allow even one inch of land to be split from the territory of the motherland .
there is an old saying in china : good will be rewarded with good , and evil with evil . if it is not rewarded , the time has not yet come . once the time comes , everything will be rewarded .
safeguarding the motherland 's unification is the greatest " good . " to the chinese people , splitting up the motherland is the most serious " evil . "
if the " taiwan independence " and splittist forces risk universal condemnation and go further down the road of " evil , " they will certainly be punished by history .
all chinese people , including the taiwan compatriots and the taiwan officers and men , let us unite to oppose a split , stop " taiwan independence , " and jointly strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland .
the pla has made adequate preparations for military actions against taiwan . it has been making preparations since the times of mao zedong and deng xiaoping .
there is no question that the pla can beat taiwan , including fighting the united states .
zhao guojun , commander of a naval fleet [ bureau record shows him as deputy chief of general staff of the navy ] , said : there are overseas reports saying that the pla does not have the power to attack taiwan .
there are currently forces in the united states that do not want to see china reunified .
jin renxie , chief of staff of the chengdu mr , said : the key now is whether the new leader to be elected in taiwan will promote one china or two china 's after he assumes the post .
early one morning several days ago , press photographers were sauntering outside a bank . that was because the people of beijing were queuing up here .
it seems that more people are taking out bank deposits to buy tax - free long - term treasury bonds this year since the introduction of the interest tax last november .
people may notice that in his " report on the work of the government " today , premier zhu has rongji devoted a lot of paragraphs to discussions of the economy .
the following are some of the examples : - - through practice and explorations in the past few years , we have accumulated rich experience in dealing with inflation and have gained some initial experience in curbing deflationary trends .
- - at the same time , we should also adopt positive measures and seriously guard against and prevent financial risks .
- - we should make reform measures more transparent , improve people 's psychological expectations , and encourage people to increase immediate spending .
- - we should actively promote service - type consumption , such as telecommunications , tourism , and cultural , recreational , health care and sports facilities .
analysts believe that the use of these new terms in the government work report highlights the new response and new policies of the government leadership in coping with the new economic situation .
in its new proposals , the government has come to understand the importance of " consumption " and " service " and that these two markets represent the real " domestic demand . "
however , some risks seem to be present all the time .
this saying figuratively shows that this is indeed an absurd cycle .
after the issuance of 210 billion yuan worth of long - term treasury bonds in two consecutive years , china will be issuing another 100 billion yuan of treasury bonds this year .
zhu rongji says that this has been " controlled within a tolerable scope " and that " the ability of fiscal repayment is guaranteed . "
observers here believe from what they see of the government 's new response under the new economic situation that china can still expect steady economic growth this year .
at the opening ceremony of the cppcc session , cppcc vice chairman ye xuanping pointed out : the respective return of hong kong and macao to the embrace of the motherland has marked significant headway in our great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland .
the sacred mission of settling the taiwan issue and bringing about a complete reunification of the motherland has now been emphatically placed before the people of the entire country , including taiwan compatriots and all chinese residing overseas .
the chinese people have the determination and the absolute ability to bring about an early settlement to the taiwan issue , and to complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland .
both inside and outside the meeting place of the " two sessions , " topics on the taiwan issue and the reunification issue still remain the focus of discussion among the delegates and members .
cppcc member yun damian expressed his support for the one - china principle , and reiterated his resolute opposition to separatist activities of various forms .
he pointed out : throughout the history , taiwan has always been one part of the chinese territory and a province in china ; therefore , no matter how hard one may try to advocate the " two - state theory , " he cannot change anything .
li denghui 's " two - state theory " is a ridiculous statement .
as regards the timetable for the settlement of the taiwan issue , he believed it is hard to tell for sure , and the crux of the matter is that the issue cannot be dragged on indefinitely .
chen jinlie personally believed that the candidate from the dpp has no chance of winning the election , for the overwhelming majority of taiwan compatriots disapprove the " taiwan independence " line advocated by the dpp .
cppcc member shi ziqing noted : china always pursues a peaceful reunification .
no matter who wins the upcoming taiwan election , he cannot split the motherland . he hopes that the appearance of a new leader in taiwan can help prompt political negotiations between the two sides of the strait .
he also believed that the settlement of the issue should not be put off indefinitely and a specific deadline should be set for the final settlement of the issue .
all the respondents of the survey noted : the white paper on the one - china principle has once again declared to the world that the chinese government will make no compromise or concession to anyone on the issue of the one - china principle .
since the publication of the white paper , the cry of all circles in taiwan society for paying attention to the cross - strait crisis and returning to the " one - china " policy has become increasingly high .
hence , actually there is no change in the cross - strait policies of the kuomintang . it has just continued to play word games .
in particular , they have no clear policies and propositions for taiwan 's crucial position during political talks and concerning the definition of one china , which makes the taiwan people in all walks of life feel extremely anxious .
the election observation team which was composed of several scholars and experts recently scored the five election pairs on their cross - strait policies , and the results showed that the cross - strait policies of none of the election pairs could attain the acceptable level .
hence , scholars and experts of this observation team called on the voters to be careful in selecting the candidate for the future president .
taiwan public opinion held that cross - strait relations have reached an extremely important critical moment and that during the last stage of taiwan 's presidential election , the cross - strait issue will continue to ferment and become the biggest variable which influences the results of the election .
npc vice chairman buhe is a mongolian and is former chairman of the inner mongolia autonomous regional government .
he said : we should fully understand the great strategic significance in the work of actively developing west china . we should seize precious opportunities , work urgently , and take immediate actions .
buhe pointed out : the work of actively developing west china is a large - scale and systematic project . we must stress key tasks and systematically implement them .
we should expeditiously develop infrastructure construction projects , earnestly intensify efforts to enhance ecological and environmental protection , actively facilitate industrial restructuring , strive to develop scientific and technological education programs , and continue to deepen reform and open up wider to the outside world .
he held : whether we can truly develop china 's west regions depends on people , on correct leadership , and on the implementation of policies .
we should strengthen leadership , intensify propaganda , and improve laws and regulations .
we should regard developing china 's west regions as an opportunity for us to comprehensively facilitate various tasks .
we should enable the broad masses of cadres and people to earnestly , comprehensively , and correctly understand the central authorities ' strategic plans so that we can properly carry out this great undertaking which has eternal impacts on future generations .
soon after taking a seat at the beijing hall of the great hall of the people , li said : " as an npc deputy of the beijing municipality , i am going to deliberate the government work report with you .
i hope we shall center our discussion around the report .
i shall also air my views in my capacity as a deputy . "
li 's remarks enlivened the atmosphere at the meeting place .
deputies asked to speak one after another . they heatedly expressed their views around the government work report they heard at the opening ceremony of the session in the morning .
the main topics discussed by the deputies today involve reducing the burdens of primary and middle school students , advancing quality education , and stepping up moral character education among teenagers .
in their speeches , zhang gongqing , sun weigang , and li jinhai said that education should serve the cause of socialism and meet the growing needs of society .
in her speech , wang lingfei said : at the ongoing enterprise reform , it is necessary to show concern for the interests of workers and staff members and make proper arrangements for those who are laid off .
we should tighten supervision over state - owned enterprises and improve the mechanisms for stimulating and restraining large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises in order to be able to administer enterprises according to the law .
jiang xiaoke , who has been engaging in environmental protection work for many years , has repeatedly talked about this issue at panel discussions .
in her view , the beijing municipality has taken air pollution control as a focus of its work and has attained some results .
in the future , it will be necessary to continue to take effective measures to step up environmental protection work in the whole of society .
full consideration should be taken of the protracted and complex nature of this work and ensure , in terms of mechanism , the success of this work by formulating relevant laws and regulations .
li peng listened attentively to the views of the deputies and seriously took notes . after the deputies finished speaking , he expressed his views .
first of all , he said he agreed with the government work report made by premier zhu rongji on behalf of the state council .
later , he put forward his views on various issues , such as the correct handling of the relationship between reform , development , and stability ; china 's accession to the world trade organization (wto) ; the advancement of quality education ; and intensified control of the environment .
li said : reform is an exploration process . therefore , when working out reform measures , we should take into account the capability of society , people , and enterprises to withstand the strains .
in line with central planning , the beijing municipality should grasp well the intensity of reform in order to maintain social stability and make the people live and work in peace and contentment .
with regard to china 's accession to the wto , li pointed out : the world should not be dominated by one country or a small number of countries . political pluralization is conducive to world peace .
economic globalization , which is the trend of the times , presents us with both opportunities and challenges .
on the one hand , we should seize the opportunities and take the initiative ; on the other hand , we should learn how to protect ourselves , pursue the good , and avoid the bad .
with regard to the question of advancing quality education , li said : " with a mighty force passing through a difficult path , " this baton is affecting our quality education .
society needs all kinds of talented people . it is necessary to change the outdated concept concerning talented people and advocate the need for " every profession to produce its own leading authority . "
we should see the arduous nature of reducing the burden of primary and middle school students . the whole society should be concerned with this issue .
li is very concerned about the work of the beijing municipality .
he said : last year , the beijing municipality made a lot of progress in all fields of endeavor , and the face of its urban construction changed considerably . it has contributed to the grand celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the prc .
as a beijing resident , i agree that beijing should submit an application to sponsor the olympic games in 2008 .
it is hoped that beijing will continue to exert great efforts in environmental protection work and intensify environmental control .
jia qinglin , member of the political bureau of the cpc central committee and secretary of the beijing municipal cpc committee , and he luli , vice chairman of the npc standing committee , also attended the meeting .
he pointed out that whatever work we are tackling , we must seek truth from facts and base our work on reality .
we can only achieve solid and tangible results by formulating policy and carrying out work in close connection with local reality .
the hainan and qinghai delegations gave their views on the government work report in connection with their local reality .
the atmosphere at the meeting of both delegations was enthusiastic ; jiang zemin listened by the side , interposed at times , and held discussions with the deputies on a number of issues .
after earnestly listening to the hainan delegation 's speeches , jiang zemin said that hainan is china 's largest special economic zone .
it was comrade deng xiaoping 's behest that hainan should be developed .
protecting the ecology benefits the country and the people and is a major affair related to sustainable development and to creating happiness for our posterity .
we must focus on the long term , grasp the present , make all - round plans for ecological construction and implement them year on year , doing everything possible to provide good protection .
hainan is the motherland 's treasure island with good ecology and unique resources , and we must carefully protect them and use them in a rational way .
jiang zemin emphasized that in order to make a success of all work , the party committees at all levels must have powerful cohesion and combat strength , and the party members and cadres must constantly play their vanguard and model role .
special economic zones must advance in the forefront not only in reform and opening up and economic development but also in building socialist spiritual civilization .
we must uphold the guideline of " grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , " further strengthen ideological and moral education and the building of science and culture , and further intensify the comprehensive tackling of social atmosphere and social order .
only by doing an ever better job in building material and spiritual civilization can we fully display the superiority of socialism with chinese characteristics .
after listening to the speeches of the qinghai delegation , jiang zemin said , our western regions cover a vast area and are rich in resources , and the cadres and masses of all nationalities there are hardworking and down to earth .
the purpose of the central authorities in setting out the strategy of big development of the west is to speed up development there , gradually narrow the disparities in development between the east and west , and comprehensively impel china 's modernization .
the western provinces and autonomous regions must seize the opportunity , base their work on reality , be clear about the idea of development geared to the new century , and speed up their development .
jiang zemin pointed out that in speeding up infrastructure construction with state support , the western areas must give priority to developing education and science and technology .
the key to developing the west lies in talent , and the key to cultivating talent lies in education ; it is first necessary to concentrate forces for promoting primary education .
it is necessary to devote great efforts to doing a good job in protecting and building the ecological environment .
we should gradually improve the ecological environment through returning farmland to forest and pasture and tackling soil erosion .
jiang zemin pointed out that instituting the policy of big development of west china provides good development opportunities for the provinces there .
the key to whether the opportunity can be seized and development speeded up lies in the leadership and in the quality of the personnel .
the leading party and government cadres at all levels must achieve great improvement , from ideological style to work style , so as to meet the demands of the new situation and tasks .
building a strong and effective cadre force is an important guarantee for making a success of the big development of the west .
in connection with " three stresses " education , we should enhance the quality of the cadre force and the cohesion and combat strength of the party organizations .
development of the west is an urgent task , and it is also necessary to make ideological preparations for a long period of endeavor , and ceaselessly strive to do a solid job in work .
npc standing committee vice chairman ding shisun attended the hainan delegation meeting .
he emphasized the necessity to vigorously implement the strategy of rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and to take a further step to promote the reform of the medical care system .
in the jiangsu room of the great hall of the people , the deputies concentrated their discussion on the government work report and expressed their views in light of their actual work .
ji yunshi , npc deputy and governor of jiangsu province , spoke first .
wang hongmin , npc deputy and mayor of nanjing city , believes that what the report says is simple in language but perfect in meaning , clear in concept , and feasible ; and that it has enhanced his confidence .
he also suggested that network information techniques be adopted to develop long - distance education .
li lanqing attentively listened to the deputies ' speeches , taking notes and inquiring the deputies about relevant matters now and then .
then he expressed his views .
so long as we seize the opportunities and vigorously implement the strategy of rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , we will be able to achieve great development .
he emphasized : we should attach importance to both basic scientific research and applied scientific and technological research . in particular , the applied scientific and technological research should be market - oriented and focus on industrialization .
the institutes for applied scientific and technological research should release their energy in store and become actual productive forces and new areas of economic growth by joining enterprises or by reorganizing themselves into enterprises .
legqog , chairman of the tibet regional government and an npc deputy , took the floor first .
i am greatly encouraged by premier zhu rongji 's government work report . the development of the west region as mentioned in the government work report has further increased our opportunities and enhanced our confidence in speeding up the development of tibet .
with the concern of the cpc central committee and state council and the support from the people of the whole country , the situation of tibet 's political , economic , and social development is fine .
we will seize the historic opportunity of the development of the western region and earnestly study new ideas , mechanism , and measures suited to tibet 's characteristics .
hu jintao listened attentively to the speeches delivered by the deputies . he interrupted them occasionally , exchanging his views and exploring the problems with them .
after listening to the speeches made by the deputies , hu jintao said that the central government seized the opportune moment to propose the strategy of developing the west , which has attracted attention at home and abroad .
in the final analysis , the implementation of the strategy to develop the west means continuously improving the living standards of the people and attaining common prosperity of all ethnic groups .
in the entire process of the implementation of the strategy , we should think of the masses , work for them , unite the people of all nationalities , and ensure that the strategy will bring practical benefits to all the ethnic groups in tibet .
hu jintao stressed that stability is a premise for economic development and nothing can be achieved without a stable social environment .
the continuous development of tibet 's economic construction and other social undertakings and the achievements attained in recent years are inseparable from our efforts to maintain social stability .
in the new situation , it is inevitably required by the stability of the overall situation of the whole country to maintain the stability of tibet . herein lies the fundamental interest of the people of all nationalities in tibet and the guarantee for tibet 's development .
we should unswervingly safeguard unification of the motherland and oppose separation with a clear - cut stand .
he warned taiwan 's splittist forces that those playing with fire are bound to get burnt .
taiwan is a part of the sacred territory of china , and the chinese people will by no means allow even an inch of territory to be split from the motherland .
we want to sternly warn those splittist elements that those playing with fire are bound to get burnt , and troublemakers who undermine reunification will certainly come to no good end .
the chinese government and people completely have the resolve and ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity .
we will by no means tolerate , appease , or sit by idly watching the success of any plot to split china .
any plot to split china is fated to fail .
chi haotian also offered his opinions on further reforming and improving the national defense mobilization system , the military 's participation in and support for the great development of the western region , and other issues .
beijing , 5 mar ( xinhua ) - - jiefangjun bao on 6 march is to carry a commentator 's article entitled " ' taiwan independence ' means war . "
the full text of the article follows : the release of the white paper on " the one - china principle and taiwan issue " by the chinese government has aroused strong repercussions at home and abroad .
in his government work report made at the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] , premier zhu rongji further expounded on the chinese government 's consistent position on resolving the taiwan issue .
our people 's armed forces will better undertake the sacred mission of safeguarding the reunification of the motherland in line with the requirements of the party central committee and the central military commission .
the successive return of hong kong and macao to the motherland has pushed the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland to a new historical stage .
terminating the separate state of the two sides of the strait and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland at an early date are where the fundamental interests of the chinese nation lie , as well as an irreversible historical trend .
to this end , the cpc and the chinese government have shown greatest sincerity and made utmost efforts to realize peaceful reunification in the form of " one country , two systems . "
the so - called " white paper on constitutional policies " which was issued not long ago is , in fact , a " letter of declaration on taiwan independence . "
we must never be confused by such sweet words .
at the same time , we have consistently opposed foreign forces ' involvement in the taiwan issue , as well as some us congressmen 's attempt to sell advanced arms to taiwan by means of concocting the " taiwan security enhancement act " and under all kinds of pretexts .
however , persisting in the one - china principle is the basis and prerequisite for this policy .
we have the greatest sincerity to realize peaceful reunification ; we will do our best and exert our utmost efforts to strive for peaceful reunification .
however , we must clearly point out that " taiwan independence " means war and that there will be no peace under splittism .
because " taiwan independence " and splittism can merely sabotage china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , separate taiwan from the motherland , and make it impossible to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland .
fomenting splits and seeking independence by " taiwan independence " and separatist forces under any pretexts and in any forms are all extremely great provocation [ ji da tiao xin 2817 1129 2176 5881 ] against china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
this is an extremely dangerous act of playing with fire and cannot be accepted by all chinese people .
realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is in the foremost interests of the country and the nation , the firm and unshakable will of all chinese people , and a great goal which will never be changed .
there is no room for compromise on this major issue of principle which has a bearing on the future and destiny of the chinese nation .
the chinese pla , which takes the interests of the nation as its foremost interests and the will of the state as its highest will , has always regarded safeguarding the country 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland as its sacred mission .
no matter what kinds of " taiwan independence " separatist activities may occur at present and in the future , our army will spare no efforts to fight a bloody war for the state sovereignty and territorial integrity just as it did in the past .
we will have full determination , confidence , capability , and ways to safeguard the country 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and will never allow an inch of land to be separated from the territory of the motherland .
besides , millions of pla mighty army officers and men are standing in combat readiness and maintain high vigilance against " taiwan independence " and separatist forces . they will never tolerate or sit idly by to see the success of any attempt to split up china .
there is an old saying in china . good will be rewarded with good , and evil with evil . if the reward is not forthcoming , it is because the time has not yet come .
when the time comes , one will get one 's due reward . safeguarding the reunification of the motherland is the utmost " good . " as for the chinese people , splitting up the motherland is the most serious " evil . "
if " taiwan independence " and splittist forces have the daring to do the most serious evil on earth and to travel farther and farther down the road of doing " evil , " they will certainly by punished by history .
therefore , all the chinese people , including the taiwan compatriots and the taiwan officers and men , should be united to oppose splittism , put an end to " taiwan independence , " and jointly strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland .
general secretary kim chong - il and ambassador wang yongxiang spoke glowingly of the dprk - prc friendship and expressed satisfaction with the continuous development of friendly relations between the two countries .
with the successive return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the early settlement of the taiwan issue has been put high on the agenda .
china issued a white paper on the taiwan issue not long ago , comprehensively expounding its principled position regarding the taiwan issue .
once again , the taiwan issue has aroused the wide concern of the outside world .
therefore , the taiwan issue has become one of the hottest topics at the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] that was held on 5 march .
he particularly stressed : we will not sit idly by and watch any serious separatist activities that undermine china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , promote the " two - state theory , " or the " independence " of taiwan .
senior generals of the pla delegation to the npc have expressed their support for this statement .
lieutenant general jin renxie of the chengdu military region said : we have a very clear understanding of the government 's policy toward taiwan , that is , " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems . "
we are very sincere in resolving the issue with the method of peaceful reunification .
but if the taiwan independence elements want to act arbitrarily and insist on independence , then we have to resort to the use of force .
our intention to resolve the taiwan issue by force also represents our effort to create conditions for resolving the taiwan issue peacefully .
but we will never promise giving up the use of force .
while showing their support for " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems , " chinese senior generals said that indefinite postponement of the taiwan issue is also not tolerable .
rear admiral jin mao , deputy director of the armament and repairs department of the navy and major general zheng hongtao , commander of certain base under the general armament department , said : the taiwan issue cannot be postponed indefinitely .
lieutenant general ge zhenfeng , chief of staff of the shenyang military region said : the indefinite postponement of the taiwan issue means the provocation of a war .
long - term postponement means separation . it goes without saying that we should adopt measures .
lieutenant general jin renxie said : as military personnel , we are most concerned about two things : first , economic development and social stability of our country . second , the taiwan issue .
safeguarding the motherland 's sovereignty and realization of the motherland 's reunification is an unshakable responsibility of military personnel .
making military preparations to go to the front lieutenant general li fengzhou , vice minister of the commission of science , technology and industry for national defense , said : it is a duty for military personnel to safeguard the unification and territorial integrity of the motherland .
as military personnel , we will never allow foreign forces to be involved in taiwan affairs or the taiwan authorities to act arbitrarily .
we are capable and resolute to safeguard the reunification and territorial integrity of the country .
li fengzhou said : indefinite postponement , in essence , means to substitute independence with postponement , for the final attainment of independence .
chinese people , including taiwan compatriots , will not allow indefinite postponement .
we should strive to achieve reunification of the motherland as soon as possible .
as a military person , i wish the motherland would reunify at the earliest possible date .
particularly , i wish to see the realization of reunification before i retire from the army . li fengzhou emotionally said : the moment the motherland needs me , i hope i can go to the front in my combat uniform .
lieutenant general ge zhenfeng said succinctly : " we can say for sure that we are definitely making preparations .
so long as we exist , we are making preparations . "
as zhu rongji said in his report , the chinese people are determined and absolutely able to settle the taiwan question at an early date and realize the great cause of reunification of the motherland .
several generals who attended today 's third session of the national people 's congress [ npc ] held that if the new leadership of the taiwan region declares " taiwan independence " after taking office , it means war .
once there are people trying to separate taiwan from mainland china , the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] is ready to adopt any measures , dauntlessly remove all interventions and sabotage activities , and safeguard state sovereignty and land integrity in a resolute manner .
vice admiral xu zhenzhong , former deputy commander of the pla navy , held : the principle of striving for peaceful reunification but not renouncing the use of force will not be changed .
if the new leader of the taiwan authorities dares to pursue the " taiwan independence " policy , we will adopt resolute measures , including the use of force .
rear admiral zhao guojun said : if chen shui - bian is elected and insists on pursuing the " taiwan independence " policy , our attitude is clear , that is , " taiwan independence " means war .
major general li tongmao , from the second artillery corps , said : if pro - " taiwan independence " elements announce " taiwan independence , " it means a brazen provocation to the chinese government and is tantamount to declaring war .
major general fan changlong , commander of the 16th group army , held : taiwan is going to hold the election for new leadership , and the chinese army is closely watching the election .
no matter who is elected , the chinese people will not tolerate the new leadership pursuing " taiwan independence , " and the chinese pla will adopt resolute measures to hit back .
lieutenant general jin renxie held : we will watch the policy of the new leader of the taiwan authorities on whether it will shift back to the principle of " one china , " or pursue " two chinas . "
if the new leader declares taiwan independence , our government 's stance has been very clear and we will adopt resolute measures , including the use of force .
we are fully confident to resolve the taiwan issue .
when he was asked of his opinions on premier zhu rongji 's government work report section on the taiwan issue , lieutenant general jin renxie held : the report by premier zhu comprehensively expounds the chinese government 's policy toward taiwan , and we agree with it .
as the chinese pla , we have our own responsibility . to make taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible , we have made sufficient preparations . we have the confidence , determination , and ability to resolve the taiwan issue .
xiong ziren added , hong kong and macao have both returned to the motherland . taiwan is part of the motherland 's sacred land , and we should make it return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible .
if the pro - " taiwan independence " force is dead set on having its own way , we also have countermeasures to make taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland at an earlier date .
rear admiral zhao guojun , deputy commander of the nanjing military region and commander of the east china sea fleet , held : the outside world 's estimation that china is unable to realize the reunification of the motherland is not correct .
we wish for peaceful reunification , but we also have the full capability to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and land integrity .
when talking about the taiwan issue , lieutenant general deng changyou , director of the political department of the pla air force , employed the term " be on the alert and combat - ready " [ yan zhen yi dai 0917 7109 0110 1769 ] .
lieutenant general li fengzhou , vice chairman of the science and technology commission under the general armament department , held that the people across the strait would not allow the taiwan issue to procrastinate indefinitely .
indefinite procrastination , in essence , is " another form of independence . "
lieutenant general zhu yongqing , political commissar of the air force of the chengdu military region , held : the reunification of the motherland will be realized .
we insist on the principle of " peaceful reunification , and one country , two systems . " however , if the three situations mentioned in the white paper happen , the people 's army will resolutely adopt any measures possible .
as the air force , we will be at the command of the central authorities in any time .
rear admiral jin mao , director of the armament department of the pla navy , said : the answer to the question of whether the pla has the ability to resolve the taiwan issue will be very clear if we review the history of the pla .
the government work report for this year involves extremely careful arrangements for expanding domestic demand and developing the economy , but does not include economic growth targets . this reflects that china is now making a big stride from the planned economy to the socialist market economy .
it is not so hard to fix a target for the development of the national economy .
it is necessary to increase the output of readily marketable products and to reduce or stop the production of unmarketable products in line with market demands .
the provinces and municipalities where production and sales are not enlivened should study ways to stimulate domestic demand and expand consumption . first of all , we should enable the peasants and backward areas to rest and build up strength and increase revenues .
the central government has fighting targets in its mind . not including the fighting targets in the government work report is an indicator for respecting the economic law and handling affairs according to the economic law .
to stimulate domestic demand , we should first enliven the central and western areas and then promote the production and sales of the eastern coastal areas .
premier zhu pointed out that " realizing the goal of getting state - owned enterprises out of difficulties through reform in three years is the most important task of the government . "
strictly ruling the government and strengthening the anticorruption struggle are one of the key points in the government work report .
we believe that the central authorities will thoroughly investigate unlawful and undisciplined cases , cases of embezzling state - owned assets , and cases of corruption ; and will neither give personal consideration nor be softhearted in handling these cases .
premier zhu 's exposition on " promoting the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland " has aroused worldwide attention .
provided that " taiwan independence " succeeds , not only the great cause of national reunification will be sabotaged , but china 's four modernizations drive will also be hindered .
if we want a success in the four modernizations drive and if we want to rejuvenate the chinese nation , we must check the " two - state theory " and " taiwan independence " moves .
otherwise , there will be increasing variables , trouble will become more serious , and the economic construction will eventually be hindered . so we must resolve the taiwan issue at an early date .
these remarks are of great significance and should not be taken lightly .
meanwhile , the people 's liberation army leaders made known their positions one after another , notifying that they are prepared against " three kinds of circumstances " at all times . obviously , it was a serious warning to the separatist forces and foreign forces ' interference .
the npc session transmits the chinese people 's strongest desire for settling the taiwan issue at an early date .
wang yushan asked somebody to cash his check for 180,000 yuan .
zhao wei and wang yushan have now been transferred to judicial organs for handling , and the 330,000 yuan in embezzled money was seized .
at the opening ceremony of the third session of the ninth npc committee , premier zhu rongji delivered to the meeting his second government work report since he assumed office as premier .
the report has specially devoted a separate section to the country 's building of a social security system , and this is also the first time among all previous government work reports .
indeed , along with the deepening of reform , pressure on employment is mounting , and a weak social security system has become a destabilizing factor in society today ; under such circumstances , the work of building up a sound social security system has become particularly important .
this is the first time in 10 years that the mainland side has ever criticized lee teng - hui by name in the form of a government work report and has equated the " two - state theory " with " taiwan independence . "
the report pointed out : " the chinese people have the determination and the absolute ability to settle the taiwan issue at an early date and to complete the great reunification cause of the motherland . "
the phrase " at an early date " in this sentence has aroused extensive attention .
the sonorous and forceful wording used in the government work report on the taiwan issue served to display fully to the world both the determination and the sense of urgency of the chinese government and the chinese people in ultimately realizing the great reunification cause of the motherland .
although some issues are not elaborated in separate sections in the government work report , they are each given several paragraphs of concentrated and accented expositions in the report ; and this serves to show the intensity of the government 's work on these issues in the coming period .
two typical cases in this respect are the large - scale development of china 's western region and the issue of comprehensively reinforcing management .
the large - scale development of china 's western region is a hot topic at the two sessions this year , and the issue is discussed under the section " vigorously pushing forward the strategic readjustment of the economic structure . "
then , he devoted nearly one whole page to work arrangements concerning the large - scale development of china 's western region for both the present and the coming period ; and the presentation was clear , with the stress placed on the focal points of the work .
in the subsequent paragraph , he talked about the need for bringing about a well - coordinated growth between china 's eastern region and its central and western regions , with a view to helping certain localities remove their misunderstanding that this policy treats different regions with partiality .
comprehensively strengthening management though also touched upon in all previous government work reports , the issue of strengthening management has been discussed with the greatest emphasis in this year 's government work report .
premier zhu rongji read out the government work report in a sonorous voice , which rose and fell in cadence .
throughout the report , the concept of the " new century " has appeared in four places .
all these have endowed this government work report with a strong leading significance and great profundity .
since internet is a value - added business to the telecommunication sector , all commercial networks should acquire the approval by the ministry of information industry in order to be listed on the market .
wu jichuan indicated that so far , there has been no control over commercial networks . although china supports the development of internet services , internet business should be conducted according to state rules and regulations .
on foreign investment in value - added services , wu jichuan said that there will be conditions for foreign investment in value - added business after china joins the wto .
according to report , relevant departments will work out relevant regulations governing the management in this aspect .
on the time for implementation of the method for separate payment of mobile phone charges , wu jichuan said that the plan for separate payment of mobile phone charges has been submitted to higher levels for approvals , but we do not know when it will be approved .
wang guixiu held that under the cpc 's centralized leadership structure , the concepts that " the party is above the npc " and that " the party is above the law " are deep - seated in china .
since the npc is the highest organ of state power , the party should not directly issue orders by overriding the npc or its enacted constitution and laws . moreover , the party should provide support for and guarantee npc work .
at the same time , the party itself should act within the constitution and the law reviewed and adopted by the npc and should be subject to npc supervision .
zeng peiyan said : development is a crucial factor for us to resolve all problems lying before us .
the most important starting point of this year 's economic work is to maintain a relatively rapid growth of the national economy .
this is of crucial importance in resolving pronounced contradictions arising in china 's economic life , maintaining social stability , and boosting confidence at home and abroad in our country 's economic development .
naturally , what we are seeking must be a growth rate based on ready markets and sound efficiency and void of exaggeration .
zeng peiyan pointed out : the main tasks of the national economic and social development in 2000 are as follows : 1 . continuing to expand investment scale and further optimizing the investment pattern .
what is difficult in achieving the expected economic growth target for 2000 is to strive for a relatively rapid growth in investment .
vigorously promoting the strategic restructuring of agriculture and the rural economy and improving the overall quality and performance of the rural economy .
continued efforts will be made to strengthen the construction of agricultural infrastructure with the stress on water conservancy .
intensifying industrial restructuring efforts to improve the quality and performance of industrial growth .
striving to create a good external environment and actively promoting reform and development of state - owned enterprises .
continued efforts will be made to expand the scale of capital reserve for banks to write off bad debts of banks , which will be mainly used in closing down bankrupt large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises and mines where resources are exhausted .
an earnest job will done in the work of converting bank credit rights to equity in some large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises and combine such conversion work , mechanism transformation , structural readjustment , and improved management in real terms .
more financing channels will be opened for enterprises . market supply and demand will be regulated promptly by comprehensively using planning , financial policy , monetary policy , and economic levers .
the activities to manufacture and sell fake and shoddy commodities will be cracked down on severely .
the social security system will be improved . 5 .
strengthening implementation of a proactive fiscal policy and making greater use of monetary policy .
efforts will be made to continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and issue long - term treasury bonds worth 100 billion yuan so as to expand investment needs , and give effective greater financial support to economic development .
more base currency [ ji chu huo bi 1015 4342 6303 1578 ] will be put into circulation in line with the needs of economic development and money supply will be expanded appropriately . 6 .
carrying out a strategy of large - scale development of the western region to promote coordinated growth of regional economies . 7 .
continuing to raise the level of opening up and making still better use of both domestic and international markets and resources .
an effective job will be done in various fields of preparatory work for china 's entry to the world trade organization . 8 . adhering to a strategy of sustainable development and successfully protecting and improving the environment .
the combination of industrial pollution prevention and control and industrial restructuring will be upheld . 9 .
and stepping up efforts to invigorate the nation through science and technology as well as education and comprehensively developing all social undertakings .
reform of the management structure of scientific research institutions throughout the country will be completed basically this year .
forces will be concentrated on key basic research projects and key projects , such as digital high division television , broadband high - speed information network , industrial automation , civil airplanes , and civil satellites and on developing newly rising industries .
education reform and development will be accelerated and quality education will carried out in a comprehensive way .
according to the state plan , 120,000 graduate students and 1.8 million students studying in regular and special courses in ordinary universities and colleges will be enrolled in 2000 .
zeng peiyan , minister of the state development planning commission , stressed today at the third session of the ninth npc national committee : substantive steps should be taken this year in implementing the strategy of a large - scale development of china 's western region .
zeng peiyan noted : accelerating the building of infrastructural facilities serves as a foundation for a large - scale development of the western region .
we should speed up the building of basic facilities in such fields as water conservancy , communication and transportation , telecommunications , and radio and television ; and strive to transform the resource advantage of the western region into an economic advantage .
we should persistently place a rational exploration and an effective utilization of water resources on a prominent position , and give priority to the development of water - economizing projects .
on the issue of highways construction , we should accelerate the construction of national arterial highways and provincial - regional main highways , and vigorously support the work of connecting the roads of poverty - stricken areas with arterial highways .
as concerns the construction of railways , we should further broaden trunk railway lines both inside and outside the western region .
on the basis of building main arterial airports , we should also draw up a rational plan for the building of a number of feeder airports .
vigorous efforts should be made to develop the pipeline transport of natural gas .
he indicated : strengthening the ecological building and the environmental protection is a major content of the large - scale development of china 's western region .
this year , the total acreage of returned grain plot in pilot areas is expected to stand at about 5 million mu , and the total acreage of land returned to forestry should exceed 10 million mu [ as published ] .
we should adapt ourselves to the present world situation featured by a rapid development of science and technology ; and earnestly rely on scientific and technological progresses for the exploration of resources , for the upgrading of industries , and for the improvement of the environment .
we should make full use of the existing scientific and technological foundation , and concentrate our efforts on developing science and technology that suit the industrial development of the western region .
we should pay close attention to bringing up and introducing able personnel , and create a social and policy environment that is favorable to giving play to the roles of able personnel .
zeng peiyan said : the state will make a greater input in the country 's central and western regions , and will increase the intensity of financial transfers and payments .
to accelerate the development of the western region under the new situation , we should mainly make use of the market mechanism , absorb funds from all sides , and satisfy the country 's huge demand for funds .
we should perfect relevant policies ; work hard to improve the investment environment ; and take bolder steps to attract foreign investment and encourage a capital inflow from the country 's eastern region .
he stressed : the large - scale development of the western region is a long - term and arduous task , which entails the hard efforts of several generations .
the people throughout the country should enthusiastically support the large - scale development of the western region ; and entrepreneurs , scientific and technological personnel , and college and university graduates should be encouraged to render meritorious services in the western region .
we should not blindly expand productive capacity that finds no market , still less should we carry out construction of low - level duplicated projects .
zeng peiyan expounded on the measures for expanding effective demand to be adopted in four fields : - - vigorously open up the urban and rural markets and vigorously expand consumption and demand .
- - vigorously advance reform of investment and money - lending systems and strive to formulate system and create conditions for increasing effective demand .
first , the reform of investment and lending systems should be advanced with earnest efforts and the incentive and restraint mechanisms for enterprise investment should be improved .
the orientation for reform is to allow enterprises to have decision - making powers and to bear their own risks while carrying out self - financed development projects encouraged and permitted by the state , with an exception for major projects or specially stipulated projects .
the government will only examine whether the investments made by enterprises are in line with the state development plan , macroeconomic policy , laws and regulations , and will not directly intervene in the investment and money - lending activities of enterprises .
second , the money - lending channels for enterprises should be developed and enterprises ' strength to expand investment should be intensified .
third , good policy environment should be created and investments should be increased by encouraging and pooling social funds .
all kinds of restrictions unfavorable for social investment and development of the non - state economy should be abolished so that investments in these spheres can be expanded .
- - give play to the role of price as the lever to promote economic growth and structural readjustment .
continued efforts should be made to rationalize the relations between prices and improve the price mechanism .
it is necessary to properly raise the prices of water supply for water conservancy projects , urban water supply , and public communications , and strengthen the work of charging the disposal of polluted water and trash .
in reforming the pricing system for electricity , we should form a mechanism and adjust the structure of the prices of electricity .
on the basis of standardizing the educational cost , it is necessary to rationally adjust the standard of school fees .
strenuous efforts should be made to consolidate the order of prices .
by adopting these measures , we will be able to promote the development of infrastructure and public undertakings and increase the consumption of urban and rural residents .
- - work in real earnest to strengthen management and the legal system , standardize and improve the order of socialist market economy .
to ensure that the infrastructure construction projects financed by treasury bonds issued over the past two years will be built expeditiously and yield benefits , we will need to continually increase investments in them .
we will also need to increase a certain amount of investments on preliminary preparatory tasks for certain major projects concerning our overall national economic development such as the development of china 's western regions .
investment in capital construction from the central budget will total 89.3 billion yuan ( including subsidies for local authorities ) .
second , we will strive to support the reform and development of state - owned enterprises .
third , we will invest more in enhance social security and fully implement the policy to readjust income distribution introduced in 1999 .
fourth , we will strive to increase investments in education , science , technology , and agriculture and ensure that the rate of increase is higher than that of the regular revenue .
fifth , we will appropriately increase expenditures for state security .
since the army , the armed police force , and procuratorial , judicial , and public security organs no longer engage in business or run enterprises , an additional 5.6 billion yuan will be provided to cover the necessary expenditures for the performance of their functions .
xiang huaicheng said : total revenue in the central budget for 2000 is 690.4 billion yuan , 50.8 billion yuan more than the actual figure of the previous year , or an increase of 7.9 percent .
total expenditures in the central budget are 920.3 billion yuan ( including interest on debts ) , 101 billion yuan more than the actual figure for 1999 , or an increase of 12.3 percent .
a deficit of 229.9 billion yuan will be left after setting revenue against expenditures .
such an arrangement does not involve an issuance of additional treasury bonds . on the contrary , it is beneficial for china to reflect the overall expenditures of its central budget and to monitor and control its debts .
according to the method of calculation used last year , the deficit in the central budget would be 155 billion yuan , 24.7 billion yuan less than the 1999 figure .
xiang huaicheng said : total revenue in the local budgets for 2000 amounts to 1.0434 trillion yuan , an increase of 7.8 percent over the actual 1999 figure .
total expenditures in the local budgets amount to 1.0434 trillion yuan , an increase of 8.3 percent over the actual figure for 1999 .
xiang huaicheng specifically explained : china has formulated the central budget for 2000 two months earlier than previous years . in the future , we will gradually schedule the formulation even earlier .
compared with international practice , there is still considerable room for china to issue treasury bonds .
for the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .
despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .
this is the price the government has to pay for the implementation of macroeconomic control and regulation , and is worthwhile .
as long as the state maintains sustained rapid and healthy economic development , constantly increases economic benefits , and records relatively rapid growth in fiscal revenue , its repaying capability will become increasingly strong .
to explain his proposal , he discussed the following eight areas : 1 .
continuing to tighten investment management and giving full play to the role of macroeconomic regulation and control .
he said : in the past two years , our increased investment in infrastructure has produced the expected results . one of the important reasons for our success is that we correctly chose the investment direction , carried out good feasibility study , and managed the allocated funds well .
this year we must use funds derived from the national debts in the direction chartered by the state council and arrange for their use on a priority basis .
in addition , during the actual operation , we must require meticulous design , scientific construction , and strict supervision to ensure project quality .
in undertaking technological transformation projects , we must stress scientific and technological progress and industrial upgrading ; we must avoid redundancy of construction in disguise or blind expansion of production capacity . 2 .
strengthening tax collection and management to ensure sustained and steady increase in revenue .
effective this year , the locally formulated policy of refunding collected tax payment shall , without exception , cease to be enforced .
tightening budgetary management and steadily promoting the reform of the budget system .
he said : the main content of the on - going reform of the budget system is to further divide the budgetary categories and compiling departmental budgets .
investigation and study should be conducted to distinguish between different situations and to rationally determine the numbers of employees and quotas of work of a department to provide important basis for compiling the budget for the department and for evaluating the implementation of the budget .
efforts should be made to comprehensively review the budgetary unit 's revenue and expenditure to lay a good foundation for reforming the budget compiling process .
steps should be taken gradually to expand the scope of government procurement to include all office stationery , equipment , facilities , and related services .
in addition , efforts should be made to study the implementation of a centralized treasury disbursement system as a fundamental measure for strengthening management , combating corruption , and promoting clean government . 4 .
intensifying efforts to readjust the pattern of expenditures to put more emphasis on key items and ensure that major principles and policies of the party and the government are implemented .
second , we should step up the reform of institutions and treat them differently based on their different situations .
third , we should gradually reduce our direct investment in competitive areas to create a good environment for fair competition among enterprises .
fourth , we should increase our financial support of the building of state power , strive to increase the budget for this purpose , and ensure functionaries of state power are paid in full and on time . 5 .
doing better social security work and accelerating the establishment of the social security system .
vigorously promoting reform of taxes and fees and further rationalizing distribution relations .
he said : the entire tax and fees reform program , which has been developed through overall planning , will be implemented step by step .
at present , we have completed the legislative procedures for reforming the transportation and vehicle tax and fees , and preparations for implementing regulations on fuel and vehicle procurement tax are basically completed .
other provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities directly under the central government may also select a small number of counties and cities for this reform on a trial basis . 7 .
strengthening financial supervision and management and rectifying financial and economic order .
third , we should raise the quality of accounting information and implement a system of appointing accountants or a system of chief accountant .
fourth , we should step up the review and consolidation of economic notaries and other intermediary organs , regulate the business operation of intermediary organs in society , and strengthen self - discipline within the trade .
adhering to the principle of hard work , plain living , and building the country through diligence and thrift , and fostering awareness of practicing frugality and utilizing funds in an economic manner .
the masses are very unhappy about this .
we must carry forward this principle and persist in it indefinitely from the high plane of strengthening political awareness .
we should establish the necessary system and mechanism in financial work to ensure that this principle is implemented . we should do so by reforming our budgetary management system and improving the financial supervision system .
in a way , this regulation contradicts another document previously issued by the ministry of information industry and other departments requiring foreign firms to hand over their encrypted communications keys ( codes ) to the public security department for national security reasons .
sources said the new regulation is of a corrective nature , because the former document " is impractical and difficult to implement . "
impractical and difficult to implement china 's compulsory requirement for foreign firms to hand over their encrypted keys for internet security reasons has aroused strong resentment .
foreign firms suspect that this measure will compromise their business security .
the present requirement to report the encryption method alone is just like asking them to give the model of their safes without asking for the combinations .
this protects privacy in internet communications . internet access still subject to restrictions on the mainland no unit or individual in china is allowed to use imported encryption technology . even the use of domestic encryption methods has to be approved . otherwise , it is considered illegal .
china has just organized an internet police force . from the ministry of security to various provincial and city security bureaus , there is a specialized team to tackle internet crime .
sources said that china 's internet security technology is at least five years behind taiwan , and 90 percent of its websites are not safe .
the construction of this " golden belt " is a key component part of the strategy for developing the western region on a large scale , which initiated recently .
the xinjiang uygur autonomous region recently made public its key investment projects in 10 sectors , such as energy resources , telecommunications , and environmental protection areas , involving a total investment of 180 billion yuan .
legqog , chairman of the tibet autonomous regional people 's government , said that " in addition to striving for obtaining the state policy and monetary assistance , we should assimilate investment through various channels according to the law governing the market economy . "
it is reported that relevant departments are now striving to increase their investment in the construction of infrastructure facilities in the western region , so as to create an environment more suitable to opening this region to the outside world .
specialists maintained that although the west lags behind the east in many aspects , such as technology , talents , and infrastructure facilities ; the western areas , bounded by 10 - odd countries , have favorable conditions for comprehensively opening themselves to the outside world .
party and state leaders jiang zemin , li peng , zhu rongji , hu jintao , wei jianxing , and li lanqing attended the meeting .
tian jiyun , executive chairman of the session and presidium chairman in charge of day - to day business , presided .
as entrusted by the state council , zeng peiyan , director of the state development and planning commission , delivered a report on the execution of the national economic and social development plan for 1999 and the draft national economic and social development plan for 2000 .
as entrusted by the state council , minister of finance xiang huaicheng delivered a report on the execution of the central and local budgets in 1999 and the draft central and local budgets for 2000 .
he said that on the basis of steady growth in the national economy , the execution of the 1999 central and local budgets was relatively good .
national treasury revenue was 1.1377 trillion yuan , 105.3 percent of the budgeted figure ; and national treasury expenditure was 1.3136 trillion yuan , 104.2 percent of the budgeted figure .
revenue and expenditure were counterbalanced , with expenditure exceeding revenue by 175.9 billion yuan .
the new millennium has arrived and all trades and professions are flourishing .
there were rapid economic growth and comprehensive social development and a new , gratifying prospect was opened up for economic and trade work . "
remarkable success achieved in reducing losses or increasing profits in 1999 he pointed out : remarkable success has been achieved in reducing losses or increasing profits since 1999 .
while continuing to cut down on cotton spinning and personnel , the textile industry , which is listed as a potential area of breakthrough in reforming soe 's and extricating them from their predicament , intensified efforts to make readjustment to bring about distinct improvements in its economic returns .
from january through october , the net loss of state - owned and state - controlled textile enterprises decreased to 293 million yuan , which was 3.343 billion yuan less than in the same period of the previous year .
the metallurgical , power , tobacco , and gold industries continued to enjoy fairly good profits .
the building material industry got out of the red and the nonferrous metals industry substantially cut its losses .
most industries could achieve or surpass their annual profit targets .
most localities saw distinct improvements in their economic results .
from january through october , the economic returns of state - owned and state - controlled industrial enterprises in 26 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities were better than in the same period of 1998 .
key state enterprises ' economic returns rose quite rapidly .
according to statistics compiled on 505 key state enterprises that reported their operational information , 65.94 billion yuan in profits , an increase of 43.2 percent , were realized in the first 10 months .
sheng huaren said : in 1999 , efforts to execute enterprise mergers and bankruptcies were intensified and debt - to - equity swaps and key technological transformation work comprehensively carried out .
by implementing those projects , we should be able to reduce the number of losing large and medium - sized enterprises by more than 860 .
debts - to - equity swap is soe 's " trump card " in shaking off poverty the debts - to - equity swap is regarded as soe 's trump card in shaking off poverty and has society 's double attention .
to readjust the product mix and improve the competitiveness of enterprises , in 1999 the state took out a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of treasury bonds for use as interest subsidies for enterprise loans for technological transformation .
so far we have made arrangements for 647 such projects in three batches that involve a total investment of 171.8 billion yuan , including 12.76 billion yuan out of the proceeds from the issuance of treasury bonds ( 6.98 billion yuan was arranged during 1999 ) .
after these three batches of projects are put into production , the major industries will achieve or basically achieve the projected symbolic targets .
as the supply of some products in a number of industries has substantially outstripped demand at the moment , it has become inevitable to control the production and processing volume of some major products .
in the first 11 months , the coal industry produced 10.3 percent less raw coal than in the same period of the previous year and its annual output could be kept within 1.03 billion metric tons .
based on the market situation , the annual volume of crude oil processed by the petroleum and petrochemical industries could be contained at around 161 million metric tons as predetermined .
in the first 11 months , the tobacco industry produced 30.7259 million boxes of cigarettes , down 0.68 percent from the same period of 1998 .
the projected targets for controlling the aggregate supply of cement and glass also could be achieved .
in 1999 , major progress was made in the strategic reorganization of enterprises and organization and establishment of business conglomerates .
he said : in the area of controlling the aggregate supply to roughly maintain a balance between supply and demand , particular efforts would be made in the new year to control the aggregate supply in the three industries of coal , metallurgy , and sugar manufacturing .
the coal industry should further consolidate and enlarge the achievements in closing pits and cutting down on production to control raw coal output and check the trends of continuous fall in prices and continuous increase in delinquent payments for goods .
the metallurgical industry should sum up lessons from the runaway output in 1999 and intensify efforts to control the aggregate supply .
at the same time , it is necessary to substantially reduce the output of beet sugar and saccharin .
we will comprehensively accomplish the task of shutting down small coal mines and , by shutting down and stopping the production of a number of small steelworks , weed out 10 million metric tons in backward steel rolling capacity .
the existing national saccharin production capacity should be reduced by 28,500 metric tons and some of the enterprises will have to declare bankruptcy and close down .
sheng huaren said : to fit in with the needs of tackling difficult problems in reform , this year efforts would be intensified to execute bankruptcies and closures .
the reserve funds for writing off banks ' bad debts after verification would be used mainly on the bankruptcies of large and medium - sized soe 's and closures of mines exhausted of resources .
we must strengthen supervision and inspection of enterprises under the debts - for - equity scheme and cancel any projects where trickery is found and temporarily halt debts - for - equity projects for all enterprises in the same province , autonomous region , or municipality .
we will , jointly with other organizations concerned , help with the issuance of enterprise bonds by large soe 's with debt - paying ability that are assessed as meeting the requirements .
market exploitation , particularly the vigorous opening up of rural markets , is listed by the setc as an important task for this year .
we should make full use of export credit , export insurance , foreign trade development funds , and other means to advance the diversification of the export market .
at the same time , we should take practical , forceful measures to expand the export of coal , metallurgical , and refined oil products .
pay close attention to studying impact of wto accession as china and the united states have reached an agreement on china 's accession to the wto , the day is not too distant when china accedes to the wto .
looking ahead to work in the new year , sheng huaren felt the weight on his shoulders but also revealed his confidence in conversation .
at the turn of the century , the swift development of china 's information industry has aroused the wide concern of people worldwide . meanwhile , china 's information industry meets new opportunities and challenges too .
information industry 's 2 major technical take - offs minister wu jichuan pointed out : computer and communication technologies , as two major technologies of the information industry , have been developing by leaps and bounds in the 20th century .
in a short period of just 30 to 40 years since computers ' invention in 1945 , computers have gone through the evolution of four generations - - electron tubes , crystal tubes , integrated circuits , and large - scale and ultra - large - scale integrated circuits .
today , cpu chip technology has been upgraded to 0.15 microns and is now advancing toward a 64 - bit era .
especially , the arising of computer network technology helps integrate computer , communication , and multimedia technologies into one .
at the same time , the telecommunication networks evolved from human , analog , and single processing services to automatic , digital , and diversified processing ones .
in the meantime , mobile telephone , digital communications , and some new businesses developed more rapidly .
since the beginning of the 1990s , the annual growth rate of the telecommunications sector has exceeded 40 percent on average . at present , this sector still keeps on a strong upward trend .
in the january-november 1999 period , the telecommunications sector increased its business value to 282.44 billion yuan , an increase of 34.2 percent over the same period of 1998 .
of this total business volume , the value by china telecommunications corporation came to 134.63 billion yuan , up 16.6 percent ; that by china mobile telecommunications corporation was 125.74 billion yuan , up 69.5 percent ; and that by china united telecommunications corporation reached 22.06 billion yuan .
in this period , the telecommunications sector created 220.08 billion yuan in revenues , an increase of 21.3 percent .
of the total revenues , china telecommunications corporation created 143.9 billion yuan , an increase of 14 percent ; china mobile telecommunications corporation , 62.74 billion yuan , an increase of 26.9 percent ; and china united telecommunications corporation , 13.09 billion yuan , an increase of 215 percent .
mankind will march toward information - oriented era wu jichuan especially affirmed the brilliant achievements made by the ( hong kong ) china telecommunications corporation since its founding two years ago .
he added that this corporation has had great success and has been concerned and commended by all foreign investors since it completed its realignment and registered itself with the hong kong authorities in september 1997 .
in the latter half of 1999 , this corporation successfully raised $ 2.6 billion by issuing new shares to the people and fixing prices for dollar bonds .
it was the largest occasion in hong kong where enterprises issued securities for the second time through markets and in a bookkeeping form .
since then , this corporation possesses $ 70.03 billion worth of listed securities ( calculated according to the stock market prices on 25 january 2000 ) and has turned itself into the largest listed company in hong kong in terms of the value of listed securities .
mankind will comprehensively enter an information - oriented era in the 21st century . advanced information technologies help reduce the distance between different places on earth and make human society closely combined together .
therefore , in the 21st century , the information technological levels and the development of the information industry will become key indicators for judging a country 's modernization levels and overall national strength .
so , both developed and developing countries should consider forcefully developing information technologies and speeding up the pace of informationization as a cross - century strategic task . the world 's competition for information technologies and information industrial development is getting more and more intense .
to this end , the ministry of information industry also made some tentative ideas .
first , the information products manufacturing industry is the pillar and leading industry of the national economy , as well as a key material foundation for developing the information industry .
so , comprehensively vitalizing the information products manufacturing industry and occupying markets as many as possible are arduous tasks of urgent importance .
relevant specialists predicted that the value of such products will reach 6 trillion yuan by 2010 .
the ministry will further readjust the industrial structure and realign relevant enterprises . information industrial enterprises should expand technological development and innovation , mobilize forces from all fronts to develop microelectronic products and the new generation of digitized information products , and form mass production capacity .
in particular , enterprises should acquire the capability to design and manufacture chips and to independently develop and manufacture key products for information networks .
second , software is the key to support the application of information technologies , such as computer , communication , and network technologies . the software industry is called the " golden industry " in the 21st century .
third , it is imperative to facilitate the development of the information industry . priorities should be given to the construction and development of information infrastructure facilities .
fourth , the development and utilization of information resources is the key to developing the information industry .
in the foreseeable future , particular attention should be paid to developing and using information services and electronic commercial information resources .
a series of supporting policies and measures should be worked out to encourage all sectors and all levels to forcefully develop various kinds of information resources and to extensively use all kinds of information services .
at the same time , we should strive to strengthen market standardization , technical norms , credit security , and the supervision over law enforcement ; ensure that such resources can be shared by all ; and make information resources better serve the economic construction and social development .
fifth , information technologies should further be popularized among and applied by all trades and professions .
china 's economy , technology and development are in a very crucial historical period .
regarding this , minister of science and technology zhu lilan told a reporter emphatically that high technology and its industrialization are the commanding heights of this century that must be occupied .
although the road ahead is not smooth , china 's experiences in struggle have given it the confidence of moving toward even brighter prospects .
first , with the gradual formation of the integrated pattern of the world 's economy , economic competition among countries has become more and acute .
third , deng xiaoping 's conclusion that " science and technology are the primary productive force " has been understood by more and more people .
however , on the other hand , being a big developing country , china has its own strong points and characteristics .
therefore , compared with the developed countries , there is a gap between china and these countries on the whole , but in some aspects , china has made development and has even leaped forward .
these show that only if the developing countries give prominence to their own strong points , can they develop their own new and high - tech industries and increase their competitiveness .
besides , viewed from the dynamic and historical angle , our growth momentum is also very great although our actual strength and scale are still quite small at present .
the existing 53 new and high - tech development zones are the main forces of china 's information industry .
since their establishment , their total technological , industrial , and trade income has already reached 490 billion yuan , total output value , over 400 billion yuan , profits and taxes handed over to the state , 48 billion yuan , and export volume , over 8 billion .
the total amount is not big when compared with the developed countries , but its annual growth rate is 70 to 80 percent .
the overall momentum is good .
she emphasized that at present , china 's economic development on the whole is of a dualistic structure . on the one hand , the process of industrialization has not yet been completed .
in the process of promoting technological renovation , developing high technology , and realizing the industrialization of high technology , science and technology management departments undoubtedly have undertaken unshirkable important historical responsibility .
regarding this , minister zhu has deliberated the key points of the work in the next step of the ministry of science and technology : first , it is to shift the center of work to the orbit of developing the social productive forces .
in the world today , the integration of science with the society and the integration of science with the economy have become the general trend , and knowledge is going to become the most crucial production factor .
this requires the science and technology management personnel to understand not only the laws governing science and technology development , but also the laws governing economic and social development , and the laws governing the intrinsic connections between science , technology and economy .
only in this way will they be able to comprehensively understand and grasp the connotation of science and technology work , and to better guide and promote the healthy development of science and technology work .
second , it is necessary to shift the focus of work to creating a policy environment .
with the constant improvement in the market economic structure , the effects of creating a policy environment may be far greater that those of solving a certain concrete problem in the work of science and technology management .
therefore , in promoting technological renovation , the ministry of science and technology will pay greater attention to basic , macro , perspective and " marketization " contents .
this does not mean to reduce the role of science and technology management departments at all , but is to establish functional departments that react rapidly , operate efficiently , and regulate and control effectively .
third , it is necessary to have a comprehensive view of the overall situation , give prominence to key points , and bring about leaps and bounds in science and technology development .
it is necessary to resolutely smash the structural fetters resulted from barriers between departments and regions , and solve the longstanding problems of scattered strength , waste caused by duplication , and poor efficiency .
in the " 10th five - year plan , " which will soon be formulated , the ministry of science and technology will fully expound this idea .
fourth , it is necessary to strengthen combination , cooperation and integration , and systematically promote technological renovation and the industrialization of high technology .
in particular , after changing the structure of science and technology institutions and the localization of management , various localities have greater space for the allocation of science and technology resources , and they have better conditions for playing a positive role in technological renovation .
at present , china has a sellers ' market in science and technology .
only pressure can promote development and only demand can lead to progress .
therefore , what is important is that china should have strength in competition .
for example , the level of china 's computer integrated manufacturing systems (cims) in 1980 could not be compared with that of other countries at all . at that time , no one was willing to cooperate with us even if we wanted to .
with our efforts in the past 10 years and more , china has greatly increased its comprehensive national strength .
today , over 200 enterprises are carrying out cims demonstration projects and have obtained very good results . the beijing no. 1 machine tool plant has even been awarded a leading industrial prize by the united states .
be brave to blaze new trails , usher in situation of opening up wider to outside world minister zhu specially mentioned the renovation system of the country and emphasized that it is not a simple project .
she pointed out that being the government , it should create an environment for all sectors to display their creativeness and enthusiasm .
enterprises must become the main body in technological renovation before they are able to participate in the international competition today .
" in the 1950's , it took 50 years to double the total volume of human knowledge , but by 2020 , it will take only 73 days to do so .
therefore , if human beings cannot catch up in their studies , they will become new illiterates . "
of course , the so - called " knowledge " is not general knowledge , but knowledge that can be used for renovation .
the world 's competition does not believe in tears .
she said that once the sense of renovation is changed into concrete actions , very big changes will take place .
for example , in a remote place in yunnan where the ecological environment was quite poor , a system for upgrading agriculture has been jointly promoted by the government , technological personnel and local peasants and fundamental changes have taken place in the entire ways of production .
therefore , we must establish a very important guiding ideology in developing high technology today : " not aristocrat - based , but common people - based . "
" in carrying out economic structural adjustment , we not only should solve current prominent problems , but , more importantly , should set eyes on long - term development . "
while discussing the " report on the work of the government , " the hainan delegation attending the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] completely echoed a call in the report to forcefully carry out strategic adjustment of the economic structure .
the deputies said , having suffered from being eager for quick success and instant benefits , they have begun to realize the good of being down - to - earth .
in 1999 , hainan achieved marked results in adjusting its industrial structure - - historical breakthroughs were made in developing its tropical high - efficiency agriculture and island tourism industry , which are the two pillars and key industries of hainan .
the province 's tropical agriculture and its unique geographical location were transformed into a potentially very strong industrial advantage of the province .
deputy wang xiaofeng , governor of hainan , said : in carrying out industrial structural adjustment , we must seek truth from facts and have a long - term plan .
a few years ago , when hainan was established as a province and a special economic zone , attracting many people from other provinces and abroad to hainan to seek development opportunity , the province bore the notion that it might get rich overnight .
the " bubble economy , " which was mainly demonstrated by a trade and real estate fever , caused serious damages to hainan 's economic development , pushing the economy to a low ebb at one point .
the practical industrial structural adjustment has laid a sound industrial foundation for hainan , enabling the province 's economy to develop rapidly and the economic results to improve ; as a result , the quality of its economic growth has improved notably .
having gone through the change from " getting rich overnight " to " working in the light of the reality , " many hainan deputies said with deep reflection : industrial structural adjustment must be carried out in the light of local conditions and we must be pragmatic .
in accelerating development , we must not again take the old path of extensive management or the low - efficiency approach , or follow the path of " bubble economy " .
the deputies gathered in the sichuan room , the great hall of the people , and vied with each other to speak in an atmosphere filled with enthusiasm .
sichuan 's failure to keep up will affect the overall situation of western region development and hold back national development .
we have a very rare opportunity at present , and we must understand , treasure , and seize this opportunity and accelerate development . "
deputy liu yingming pointed out : we should give priority to educational development during the information era because education determines a nation 's rise and fall .
to develop the western region , we should first focus on training professional people , and create a fine environment for innovative people to grow .
he also urged everyone to attach importance to the educational and economic burdens of primary and middle school students in rural areas , and to improve educational conditions in civilian - run primary schools .
li lanqing listened to the deputies ' speeches , carefully took notes , and now and again asked deputies for more details as well as exchanged opinions with them .
chi haotian said : our army is the strong pillar for the people 's democratic dictatorship and assumes the sacred mission of defending national security and protecting social stability .
chi haotian said : we should vigorously train and cultivate new types of military personnel with high quality , conduct deep - going training in science and technology , and strive to improve our ability in directing military affairs and mastering a modern war .
we should further carry out reform and improve the mobilization system for national defense and actively take part in and support the massive development project in the western region .
taiwan is an inalienable part of china 's sacred territory . the chinese people will never allow the split of an inch of land from the motherland 's territory .
for a long time , the separatist forces in taiwan , by relying on the support of certain big countries , intentionally sabotage the principle of one china and obstruct the course of peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait .
last year , li denghui [ li teng - hui ] openly dished out the " two states theory , " took an extremely dangerous step on the road to split the motherland , and seriously undermined the cross - strait relations .
the chinese government and people have always kept a high degree of vigilance toward splitting activities by taiwan 's separatist forces and have waged resolute struggles . this has shown the strong determination of the chinese people to oppose a split and protect unification .
the pla must strengthen preparations against war , be ready at all time , and assume the sacred task of protecting the unification of the motherland when the situation requires .
we must tell taiwan 's separatists in all seriousness that those who stir up a fire will burn themselves , and choosing " taiwan independence " means choosing war .
those troublemakers who rely on foreigners to strengthen their own position and sabotage reunification will certainly come to no good end .
the chinese government and people are fully determined and capable to protect state sovereignty and territorial integrity . all separatist schemes are doomed to failure .
the deputies spoke in enthusiastic fashion , and at times interposed in the discussion on the issues raised .
wu jihai , a deputy from a minority - nationality area , spoke first . he proposed that the state should support the development of minority - nationality areas and intensify the work of tackling tough problems in poverty relief .
deputy zheng maoqing said in his speech that the reforms of state enterprises have achieved great progress in eliminating losses and increasing profits , restructuring industry and products , and establishing a modern enterprise system .
in order to continue to develop , they must carry out restructuring , practice strict management , refrain from acting in a showy fashion or making a fuss over trivialities , and do their work in a thoroughly sound way .
deputy wu zongyuan spoke of seizing the opportunity of the great development of the west to exploit regional strong points .
in view of the flood - fighting situation in the dongting lake region last year , deputy cai lifeng from yiyang in hunan proposed a series of measures for self - salvation through production in the disaster areas .
regarding agriculture and rural work , he proposed that it is necessary to attach importance to the peasants ' interests , and step up the building of a socialized service system for agriculture , to provide financial and fiscal help for the rural areas .
deputies duan youlin and li youmei also gave their views on a number of problems in grassroots rural work .
zhu wan , zhong zhihua , and liang wengen spoke on high technology and its industrialization , developing the enterprises through science and technology , and how to resolve problems facing economic development .
after earnestly listening to the deputies ' speeches , zhu rongji gave his views on rural economic issues .
he said that in the present situation of grain supply exceeding demand , which is a problem of structure and of the present stage , we absolutely cannot neglect and shake the status of agriculture as the basis .
as a major agricultural province , hunan particularly needs to further consolidate and strengthen agriculture and speed up agricultural restructuring .
guided by the market , it is necessary to respect the peasants ' wishes , and adopt effective measures in production and circulation to guide the peasants to reduce production of varieties that do not sell well and expand output of agricultural produce of high quality and high returns .
the state council recently issued regulations on withdrawing a number of grain varieties from the scope of purchase at protected prices , and all localities must seriously implement them .
zhu rongji emphasized that it is essential ; to do everything possible to increase peasant incomes .
in the present circumstances when the peasants ' burdens are rather heavy , lightening their burdens means increasing their income .
all localities must strictly carry out the state 's policy measures on lightening the peasants ' burdens and take proper stock of all types of irrational charges levied in the rural areas such as for education , the peasants ' house building , and the use of electricity .
carrying out reforms of rural taxes and charges is a fundamental policy for lightening the peasants ' burdens , and it is necessary to do a good job in organizing trial points .
further stabilizing and strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the country and promoting the strategic adjustment of agricultural structure are key points of deliberation by members of the heilongjiang delegation today .
deputy wang guoxue suggested that we should further protect the farmers ' enthusiasm in production and increase warehouse and storage facilities in principal grain producing areas .
deputy xu zhenhu pointed out the need to attach importance to the work of reducing farmers ' burdens and establish an effective restraining system .
deputy zhao jinchun held that , in order to promote the development of agriculture and rural economy , we must increase investment in foundation facilities for agriculture and speed up the pace in building small towns .
deputy yang xin suggested that we should actively guide the rational flow of surplus labor force in rural areas and make greater efforts to implement the policy of procuring grains at protective prices .
deputy wu nanjun , who is from the grassroots level , made the following suggestion on behalf of the vast peasant friends : the government should strengthen services for farmers , promote the development of rural economy , and quicken the pace of enabling farmers to increase their income .
after listening to the deputies ' extensive opinions and suggestions , wei jianxing spoke on how to further strengthen the building of a clean and honest government and the struggle against corruption .
he pointed out : to implement the policy of tightening party discipline , we must first of all set strict demands on leading cadres at various levels .
leading party cadres must strictly observe requirements set by the party constitution and " three stresses , " have a firm belief in communism , earnestly practice communist morality , and firmly establish a correct world outlook and concept of life and value .
we should stress party spirit and principle , and always put strictly observing political discipline in the first place .
we should establish an ideological and moral defensive line in addition to a line of defense with party discipline and state law , but the key lies in strictly keeping to the ideological and moral defense line against corruption and placing this line in the front .
leading party cadres must consciously follow the norm of being honest in performing official duties .
in light of the developing situation , we should promptly set new norms for our behaviors , remind party members in advance , and integrate the cadres ' official work and code of ethics with the norm for a socialist market economy .
wei jianxing emphatically pointed out : in order to implement the policy of tightening party discipline , we must strengthen supervision and inspection work .
we should check the situation of implementation of the party 's line , principles , policies and decisions . we should promptly expose and investigate and handle activities in serious violation of political discipline .
while strengthening and improving the work of handling the people 's letters and visits , we should take the initiative to supervise and check the situation . the party organization 's supervision should be closely linked with leading cadres ' performance of official duties and other activities .
we should continue to promote openness in government administration and in factory and village affairs . the important thing is to overcome the situation of over - concentration of power by leading members of some organizations and their lacking supervision and engaging in covert activities .
we should strengthen the practice of mutual supervision among members of a leading group .
we should attach importance to the role of news and public opinion in supervision .
the present supervision system and mechanism should be further improved and strengthened .
however , we must not simply copy the democratic mode of the western bourgeoisie .
wei jianxing pointed out : we should supervise matters before problems occur . at present , we mostly supervise matters after problems happen . this is necessary .
however , there are many problems that are hard to investigate if we do not supervise them at the beginning .
there will be too many problems to supervise if we let those problems happen first .
those problems will likely happen again . from now on , we should supervise matters early .
to strengthen supervision , we must proceed from studying the system , mechanism and administration of units to be supervised , get at the root of problems , and prevent and bring corrupt cases under control at the beginning .
wei jianxing stressed : to implement the policy of tightening party discipline , the key lies in being strict in discipline .
by exercising discipline in a strict manner , we can curb the spread of corrupt tendencies at the beginning .
only by resolutely punishing corruption , can we show the party 's determination , gain trust from the masses and effectively educate cadres .
at present , certain things are worth noticing in this respect . some people within the party are " seeking good relations with all and sundry at the expense of principle , " establishing vulgar relations with other , and being soft and lenient in exercising discipline .
toward those corrupt and degrading cadres who dare to disregard party discipline and state law , we must punish them in a severe manner .
not forcefully punishing those cadres will only generate negative results .
toward those who hide the truth and not report corrupt cases , delay the handling of those cases or set up obstacles to obstruct investigation and handling of those cases , discipline inspection and supervision organizations must seriously deal with them .
discipline inspection and supervision organizations that work with no or little efficiency in investigating and handling corrupt cases or derelict in their work should also be investigated for their responsibility .
exercising discipline in a strict manner is not practicing punitiveness or punishing without prior warning .
we always advocate a prudent attitude in dealing with people and we will pay attention to dealing with each case on its merits according to policies and law .
the tianjin delegation held a plenary meeting this afternoon at the tianjin room in the great hall of the people .
while discussing the government work report , tianjin 's deputies vied with one another in expressing their ideas in line with tianjin 's actual circumstances .
deputy lu jinfa said : at the turn of the century , the situation spurs us on . the key to fulfilling the fighting goals defined in the government work report lies in drawing - up of measures and firm implementation of these measures .
deputy pi qinsheng said : to keep abreast of the situation in entering the world trade organization , we should earnestly conduct research , accelerate the transformation of government functions , and do our work in an expeditious , painstaking , and practical fashion .
deputies shi chunsheng and hou zixin offered their respective opinions and suggestions for the work in raising the technological innovation level of state - owned enterprises and in spreading the quality education in an all - round way .
li ruihuan carefully listened to their ideas and sometimes exchanged ideas with them .
li ruihuan made a speech after listening to the deputies ' ideas .
first of all , he expressed his agreement with premier zhu rongji 's government work report .
he said : we must fully affirm the achievements ; otherwise , we cannot inspire the people 's morale and enhance their coherence . however , we must face up to the existing problems and difficulties ; otherwise , we cannot keep sober - minded and improve our work .
along with the deepening of reform and opening up and with the development of a market economy , they will face more and more problems , especially problems with the interests of the masses .
given such a circumstance , the mass work has become the key link in the effort to smoothly promote all social causes .
li ruihuan said : the so - called leadership is related to the masses . " leadership " means leading and guiding the masses . without the masses , leadership means nothing .
ours is a socialist country where the people are the masters . so the purpose of the party and the government is to wholeheartedly serve the people . everything we do is inseparable from the masses . it is either the mass work or the work for the masses .
therefore , being skilful in doing the mass work is the basic requirement and the essential technique of leading cadres .
li ruihuan pointed out : a leader is responsible for making , through effective propaganda and organization work , the masses aware of their own interests and struggle for their own interests together with others .
it is the comprehensive test to the quality of a leader that whether he can mobilize the masses , enliven and activate the masses , scientifically organize the masses to engage in various causes , and eventually achieve the ideal results .
li ruihuan said : basically speaking , reform means the readjustment of interests .
many things must be reformed . without reform , they cannot develop . however , there are many difficulties in reform .
li ruihuan pointed out : in doing the mass work , leading cadres should put themselves in a correct position , making clear that the people are the masters of the country and cadres are the public servants of the people .
cadres should straighten out their attitude and treat the people equally , sincerely , and reasonably . never should they look down the people from a height , nor should they be slipshod and unresponsive in work .
most importantly , cadres should set an example for the people , fit their actions to their words , and take the lead in practicing the moral standards and the concept of value advocated by them .
" if one is not straight himself , how can he straighten out others ? "
if one 's own face is dirty , how can he urge others to be clean ?
a person who is " a giant in words but a dwarf in deeds " cannot achieve good results in doing the mass work .
these are the remarks made by wang qiren , deputy to the national people 's congress [ npc ] and director of the liaison office of the central people 's government in the macao special administrative region [ sar ] , during an interview given to this reporter .
wang qiren , who previously attended the npc sessions on numerous occasions in the past , experienced a different feeling this year .
as a member of the guangdong delegation , he said that he had obtained the concern , support , and help of the guangdong delegation when he attended the npc before macao 's handover on 20 december 1999 .
following macao 's return to the motherland , the macao residents have become masters of their own affairs under the policy of " one country , two systems " and " macao people ruling macao . "
wang qiren pointed out that issues deliberated by the macao npc deputies will not constitute interference in the internal affairs of the macao sar .
as an official in charge of the liaison office of the central people 's government in the macao sar , wang qiren added , " we will firmly implement the principle and policy of the central government on implementing 'one country , two systems ' in macao . "
" following the implementation of the 'one country , two systems ' policy in macao after 20 december 1999 , we should try to comprehensively implement and improve it in practice .
in the two months or so since the reversion of macao , wang qiren told this reporter , all localities in the interior have shown concern for macao . macao has also become the focus of world attention .
thanks to the concern and support of the macao compatriots , the macao sar government has done a great deal of work . the administrative departments have enormously increased their efficiency .
great changes have taken place in the macao community . public order has improved , the society is stable , and the economy has recovered . we believe that there will be further development in the future .
following the reversion of macao , wang emphatically pointed out , the original capitalist system and lifestyle remain unchanged . the political framework is operating as usual .
macao 's laws also remain unchanged .
the implementation of the " one country , two systems " policy in macao over the past few months has been good on the whole .
the taiwan authorities should judge the hour and size up the situation , relinquish the splittist plot as early as possible , and bring about cross - strait dialogue on an equal footing at an early date .
deputy liu yiming said : to strive for peaceful reunification , the chinese government has repeatedly called for holding cross - strait talks on an equal footing on the basis of the one - china principle .
premier zhu rongji said this time that china is ready to hold cross - strait dialogue and talks with taiwan based on this principle and said that all matters can be negotiated . this shows the great sincerity of china .
deputy zhang yongjun said : undoubtedly , the one - china principle is the basis and precondition for realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland , because the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland allow no provocation .
running counter to this principle and engaging in " taiwan independence " and separation will undermine this basis and precondition , which means pushing the people on both sides of the strait to war .
deputy hu yafang said : as a taiwan compatriot , it is our eager desire for reunification . we do not want to see our compatriots that are our own flesh and blood engage in war .
however , we do not want to see the separation of the motherland all the more . it is hoped that the taiwan authorities would rapidly see relinquish the splittist plot to avoid the consequences that people on both sides of the strait do not want to see .
zeng peiyan pointed out that the beijing - shanghai high - speed railroad will be an important trunk road in eastern china , the most economically developed region of china , and it will be a " spine " for china 's economic development .
zeng peiyan said preliminary work of the high - speed railroad has been carried out for several years and currently is still going on , and , because of the importance of it , a very cautious and positive attitude has been adopted .
during this year 's " two sessions , " experts in railroad construction have offered many suggestions on speeding up the construction of the beijing - shanghai high - speed railroad .
a study conducted by experts shows that , after the railroad is completed , the portion of its contribution to economic development along the railroad that can be quantified will reach 22.6 billion yuan renminbi annually on the average .
at a news conference held at the press center of the " two sessions " today , zeng peiyan , minister in charge of the state development planning commission , made the above - mentioned prediction .
in the draft plan for this year 's national economy and social development submitted by the commission , economic growth rate is set at about 7 percent .
he said : to boost economic development , the state is studying relevant measures to further promote the whole society 's investment , including investment by non - governmental sectors and individuals .
zeng peiyan said that china would continue to maintain a fine development momentum on the basis of last year 's achievements .
while answering a question whether there is a deflation in china , zeng peiyan emphatically said : what china witnesses is a tendency toward deflation , not a situation of deflation .
moreover , such a tendency is mainly reflected from commodity price . although retail commodity sales have decreased for 22 months in a row , monetary supply has remained normal and economic growth also has maintained a fairly rapid speed .
moreover , in previous years when we witnessed a period of inflation , the prices of many commodities increased , which in fact has remained some space for deflation . the situation in which some commodity prices have decreased is normal .
economic operation in january this year shows that the price index in many provinces and cities have witnessed a positive growth .
zeng peiyan said : in an environment where the policy of expanding domestic demand will be continuously carried out , it is expected that the tendency toward deflation would hopefully have been alleviated by the end of this year .
zeng peiyan was also optimistic when he talked about china 's export trade .
he said : due to the fact that the overall international economic situation is getting better and that china has carried out another series of policies since the second half of last year , china 's export this year is expected to surpass the one scored last year .
zeng peiyan said that china has alleviated the strain on power supply following the construction of the power projects in the last two five - year plan periods .
in addition to the development of thermal power projects , we have made rapid headway in the construction of hydropower projects .
at present , efforts should be concentrated to ensure a good completion of the ongoing nuclear power projects as quickly as possible .
when speaking on the issue of whether it is necessary to build new nuclear power projects in the " 10th five - year plan " period , zeng peiyan said that we should first consider expanding the capacity of the existing nuclear power stations when necessary .
beijing , 6 march (zts) - - china is expected to achieve an economic growth rate of about 7 percent this year .
zeng peiyan , minister of the state development planning commission , said today : we are very confident that this expected goal can be achieved . if the plan is carried out smoothly , the economy will grow at a rate higher than 7 percent .
zeng peiyan held a news conference this afternoon and answered reporters ' questions .
third , financial input will be further increased this year and the whole society 's investment in fixed assets is expected to increase by about 10 percent . moreover , efforts will be made to study some measures for stimulating social investment so as to spur economic growth .
while admitting that in the inland there was a tendency toward deflation , zeng peiyan did not think that the inland was facing a serious situation of deflation .
he believed that the tendency toward deflation would hopefully have been alleviated by the end of this year .
therefore , it has not run around in circles when it has to act out of necessity .
these weaknesses have affected the transparency and solemnity of the central budget , and to a certain extent have also weakened the roles of people 's congresses in deliberations and supervision .
however , from another perspective , the npc has shown its efficiency in playing the supervisory role while urging the mof to speed up the process of the reform of budgetary planning .
of course , this will also help people 's congress deputies to more effectively fulfill their supervisory functions and facilitate financial supervision by all circles .
at present , the world 's economic situation is tending to be good , and our country 's investment , consumption , and import and export will all see improvement .
in the mean time , the state will also employ economic leverages such as price , tax rate , and interest rate to further expand domestic demand , so the national economy can continue to advance toward the good .
the issue of implementing the strategy of the grand development of the western region has aroused the concerns of people at home and abroad .
in the course of development , resources will be allocated in line with the market , and the mechanism of the market will be observed .
he added : this year , the grand development of the western region will achieve substantial progress . at present , a " 15 - year " plan and a plan for the grand development of the western region are under construction .
in the mean time , the early work for a batch of important projects such as " transferring gas from west to east , " " transferring electricity from west to east , " and building a rail line to tibet should be accelerated .
the 78 large - and medium - scale ongoing projects in the western region should be sped up with the kick - in of more than 30 billion yuan this year .
zeng peiyan also pointed out : the grand development of the western region is a long - lasting and arduous mission and a systems engineering project on a grand scale . it will take the efforts of several generations .
to implement the strategy of the grand development of the western region , talents are the key issue .
on the one hand , we should accelerate the cultivation of local talents , and , on the other hand , we should widely attract talents from the eastern region and overseas .
in the course of the grand development of the western region , we will start some important construction projects , which are very attractive to talents at home and abroad .
to bring forth the best talent , we should create necessary living and working conditions for them . in the course of the grand development of the western region , it is imperative to explore new thoughts and employ new methods .
when answering journalist 's question on deflation , zeng peiyan held : at present , our country is indeed witnessing a trend of deflation , but we are certainly not in a serious deflation situation .
although the consumer price and retail sales price index experienced negative growth 22 and 28 months in a row , respectively , the money supply and the loan scale of financial organs maintained normal growth rates , and the economic growth remained to be relatively speedy .
he added : with the implementation of the policy of expanding domestic demand , the overall price level will rebound gradually .
the news conference today was chaired by lu cong - min , vice secretary general of the npc standing committee . zeng peiyan and wang chunzheng , vice minister of the state development planning commission , also answered questions on other issues .
li tieying said : the key to solving china 's problems lies in development , and reform is the basic way out for fulfilling the target of production development .
in deepening reform , we are now faced with new situations , new contradictions , and new problems which we never encountered before ; particularly after our country accedes to the world trade organizations [ wto ] , we shall be facing rigorous challenges .
so , we should step up the advance study of the reform theory .
li tieying called for further emancipating the mind , seeking truth from facts , and daring to explore and practice .
it is necessary to further deepen the reform of the economic structure , with attention focused on removing the systemic obstacles to economic development .
reform measures should be conducive to bringing deflation under control , promoting the readjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure , increasing job opportunities , and adapting ourselves to the requirements of our country 's accession to the wto .
now the world economic structure is also being readjusted . advantageous industries in some developed countries are being relocated , and this offers an opportunity for us .
wu bangguo encouraged beijing municipality to make use of its advantages , such as many universities and scientific research institutes situated in the municipality , to continue its vigorous development of high - tech industries and to explore new mechanisms for applying new and high technologies in industrial production .
zhang wannian said : upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army is the basic principle for the founding of our army as well as the spirit of the army which will never change .
with this , we will be invincible and will be able to advance from victory to victory .
all officers and men , especially leading cadres at various levels , must have a very clear head , take a very firm and clear - cut stand , and act conscientiously on this point .
jiang chunyun said : in making the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , special attention should be paid to solving several problems : 1 .
we should gain an understanding of the market and adapt ourselves to it .
restructuring should be market - oriented ; we should first take market demand into consideration before making arrangements for production . 3 .
we should act both positively and properly ; we should seize the opportunity , be positive and enterprising , and achieve tangible results as soon as possible ; at the same time , we should not act with undue haste or rush headlong into mass action .
jiang chunyun said : besides , attention should be paid to combining the east with the west and making them complement each other .
now we should making an extensive review of the " three stresses " education among the leading cadres and conduct education in " bearing in mind how one has become rich and forging ahead after getting better - off " among the cadres and masses .
we should continue to put aiding the poor through development in an important position in national economic and social development and do this work with perseverance .
wen jiabao said : this is the last year of the state plan for assisting 80 million people in having sufficient food and clothing within seven years .
wen jiabao said : party committees and governments at various levels should clearly understand the long - term nature and arduousness of the aid - the - poor work and firmly establish the concept of fighting a long - term battle in this regard .
they should adapt themselves to the requirements of the new situation in the effort to aid the poor through development and study and decide on their future principles and arrangements for this work .
second , it is necessary to strengthen the supervision and restraint mechanisms , to run the party and administer the government strictly , and to effectively check corruption and various unhealthy trends .
third , it is necessary to establish the concept of the masses and to further strengthen the ties between the cadres and the masses .
wu yi said : our country started to open to the outside world by " importing " things abroad . we set up economic and technological development zones and bonded areas and opened up coastal cities with a view to attracting investment from foreign businessmen .
meanwhile , we should note , however , that tremendous changes have taken place in our economic structure and macroeconomic environment through many years of reform and opening up . this requires us to raise the level of importing things from abroad .
wu yi pointed out : to further open wider to the outside world , we also need to " export " things - - our products , personnel , and enterprises all should be " exported . "
every possible effort should be made to increase exports , especially mechanical and electrical products and high - tech products .
zhao guangzhao said : like pouring water off a steep roof , the government work report made by premier zhu rongji lays stress on the key points and is purposeful and full of new and guiding significance , and it is a very good , realistic report .
the report particularly attaches great importance to the development of education , science , and technology .
zhao guangzhao said : in our country , the cost of agricultural production is relatively high , and the prices of corn , wheat , and other major agricultural products are higher than those in the international market .
we shall face severe challenges agriculturally after our country accedes to the wto .
it is necessary to increase the contribution of advanced science and high technology to agriculture in order to strengthen our agricultural competitiveness .
ismail amat pointed out : the key to maintaining national unity lies in cadres of various nationalities .
ismail amat said : it is necessary to do mass work well in order to maintain national unity .
to maintain national unity , we must implement the party 's policy toward nationalities in an all - round way .
ismail amat stressed : in maintaining national unity , it is necessary to hold high the banner of patriotism and great national unity and prevent and crack down on all illegal , criminal activities aimed at undermining national unity , social stability , and the unification of the motherland .
wang zhongyu said : china now has a population of 1.259 billion , and there are about 10 million new births every year .
with the population base so large , the task is extremely arduous to maintain this level .
he hoped that henan province , with a population of 93 million , would continue to effectively control its population and do a good job in family planning in order to lay a foundation for all - round social and economic development .
beijing , 7 march ( xinhua ) - while examining and deliberating on the government work report , npc [ national people 's congress ] deputies from xinjiang and tibet stressed that development and stability are the two themes of the work of xinjiang and tibet .
in order to implement the strategy of large - scale development of western regions and bring about a leap forward in ethnic minorities regions ' economic development , we must resolutely safeguard social stability .
xinjiang should grasp development on the one hand and stability on the other by " persisting in firmly grasping the two aspects at the same time . "
social stability is not only important to ordinary people but also vital to investors , for only in a stable social environment will investors find it possible to do business with a sense of security .
we have already benefited in this regard : the number of individual industrial or commercial operators in qamdo prefecture has risen from more than 3,600 in 1998 to more than 5,800 early this year and the majority of them have come from the eastern provinces or regions . "
deputy shadike kariaji , vice president of xinjiang 's kaxgar prefecture islam association , stated : our country 's current religious policies are the best ones ever in history , for the people of all nationalities have been guaranteed freedom of belief .
at present , a handful of people are engaged in separatist activities and are trying to sabotage social stability in the name of religion , and this has run counter to the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities .
the broad masses of believers will never tolerate this .
shenyang , 7 mar ( xinhua ) - - in the dragon year at the turn of the century , a giant dragon - - the state - owned economic sector of liaoning - - raises its head up high .
the state - owned industries , which were incurring losses for 57 consecutive months , made up their deficits and increased surpluses instantaneously last year .
last year , liaohe oilfield , the nation 's third - largest oilfield , made a profit of 1.49 billion yuan ; fushun petrochemicals , 70 million yuan ; and liaoyang chemical fibers company [ lcfc ] , 21.37 million yuan .
the losses by fushun petrochemicals and lcfc , were as high as 2.843 billion yuan in 1998 .
big ships could only turn around slowly , and would incur losses when they switch over to the market economy . as a result , the overall performance of liaoning 's state - owned economic sector slipped .
what was more exciting was that the previous aisc , with outdated equipment and backward techniques , was replaced by a modern new aisc , equipped with full - fledged converters , continuous casting , and continuous hot - rolling machines .
first auto gold cup company , the top profit - maker among local liaoning soes , was once a major loss - making enterprise .
the kindergarten ; school ; shops ; hospital ; bank ; post office ; public security , procuratorial , and court organs ; township ; town ; and numerous streets that sit on an area within a 20 - square - kilometer circumference were totally separated from the enterprise .
the heavy burden of running society directly affected the enterprise 's participation in market competition and in building a modern enterprise system . the separation from hongwei district was the biggest maneuver made by liaoning in the reform of separating the main bodies of soes from their supplementary units .
by separating the main bodies from the supplementary units , in the last one year the province reduced subsidies of all kinds to enterprises by 3 billion yuan , which is 84 percent of the original amount of subsidies .
the major adjustment in dalian iron and steel group [ disg ] brought high returns .
disg , the earliest special steel production base in our country , was the first among others in the same trade in the country to slide downward because of products that were not competitive .
disg made up its mind to readjust the product mix and eliminate backward techniques , and lay off large groups of workers so that they could seek re - employment .
in dalian city , in the two years of 1998 and 1999 , soes in the entire city trimmed a total of 180,000 workers and saved 2.7 billion yuan in costs and expenditures .
many soes with dried - up resources , countless losses , and more liabilities than assets were left over from the planned system , which practiced the law of natural survival , where enterprises lived but never died .
beginning last year , this law was replaced by the market law of survival of the fittest .
last year , liaoning declared bankruptcy on and closed down two especially big coal mines and seven large nonferrous metal mines whose resources were dried up , and plugged the black hole that drained profits .
some soes did not have high profit margins , and obtained rather weak economic returns .
last year , local state - owned industrial enterprises in liaoning completed 71.146 billion yuan in gross industrial output value , but made only 614 million yuan in profits , with a sales profit rate of less than 1 percent .
liaoning people , who for many years were gasping for air under the weight of the hat of losses , feel all the more excited and high spirited in the face of the favorable situation for soes .
when the dragon raises its head , it 's a signal that it is to about to fly .
the reporter asked general li laizhu whether the mainland 's cruise missiles are capable of hitting lee teng - hui 's desk just like the outside world said ?
li said : " technologically speaking , any technology has the probability of error , but it is impossible for our cruise missiles to miss their target at the desk of lee teng - hui ! "
li gave a soft smile after making these comments .
now is in a normal state of war preparedness general li maintained that as combat forces , the pla is always prepared to smash all " taiwan independence " schemes .
faced with taiwan 's current general election , the reporter asked if the mainland has to enhance the state of war preparedness ?
li answered : " it is not necessary to do so . "
he added that the chinese military is now in a normal state of war preparedness so that it is not necessary to especially raise the state .
in regard to the unfriendly statements that the taiwan presidential contenders made during the presidential election period , general li said : " candidates always make such statements in order to win the election .
whether such statements can be turned into reality depends on their behavior and performances . "
we hope to hold talks and hope to see success in the talks . however , everything will depend on the taiwan side after the general election .
he maintained that almost all questions related to the taiwan issue involve the " influence by the united states . "
he strongly denied the possibility of making concessions to the united states on the question of using force against taiwan when any " one of the three prerequisites " happens .
general li indicated that the chinese military will not be hardened to any demonstrations .
he hinted that the outside world will be able to see the chinese military 's moves of being unwilling to show weakness when the time is right .
minister of finance xiang huaicheng yesterday [ 2 march ] made a report on financial work to the national people 's congress [ npc ] session .
central expenditures exceeded revenue , leaving a deficit of 179.7 billion yuan or 600 million yuan more than the amount allowed by the npc standing committee last year .
the total local revenue exceeded expenditures , leaving a surplus of 3.8 billion yuan .
in 1999 , the combined total revenue accounted for 13.9 percent of the gross domestic product [ gdp ] , more than in 1997 and in 1998 .
on the whole , china 's current financial situation is relatively stable and in a sound condition .
what has attracted people 's attention is that in this year 's budgets , china will have a deficit of nearly 230 billion yuan , an increase of 50.2 billion yuan over that of last year .
besides , the expenditures for national defense will increase by 12.7 percent .
it may be worthwhile to make an analysis of the increase in these two aspects .
first , the increase of deficit is related to the need of stimulating the domestic demand .
since 1998 , china has been implementing a proactive financial policy or a policy to increase budget deficit . this is due to great changes of international financial and economic environments . the financial crisis in asia also had a negative influence on china .
we must use the expansion of domestic demand as a main motive force to stimulate economic development .
under such circumstances , the central government has decided to implement a proactive financial policy .
in this year 's financial statement , " following a moderately tight financial policy " is not mentioned .
the central government has used the issuance of currency and treasury bonds , and interest rate as tools , including the increase of deficit to control macro economics , and has achieved significant results .
meanwhile , people have eliminated their doubts about the possibility of inflation by adopting the policy of increasing deficit . therefore , the implementation of a proactive financial policy has become the common understanding of various departments and units .
this year , expenditure for national defense has increased by more than 10 percent and some commentators have made incorrect criticism .
china 's increased expenditure on national defense is mainly for increased use in two areas . one is the increase of wages and subsidies for officers and soldiers , and the other is for the new troops stationed in macao .
as is known to all , the income of officers and soldiers of the chinese army has been relatively low for a long time , and this situation is unfavorable to the improvement of national defense .
in fact , china 's national defense expenditures with a total amount of 120.5 billion yuan only account for 1 percent of the gdp , much lower than the world average of 3 percent .
based on the amount of national defense expenditures or on the proportion of government budget , china 's national defense cost is much less than other big countries .
in reality , the greatest increase of china 's budget for this year is in education .
the budget for education has been increased by 30 percent , and this has fully shown that the chinese government truly attaches great importance to the policy of using science and education to enrich the country and to raising the cultural level and overall quality of the people .
nevertheless , some western mass media only watch china 's increase in national defense expenditures , and disregard the increase in the budget for education .
after the conclusion of yesterday 's morning session , general xiong ziren walked out of the assembly hall with other deputies and warmly shook hands with the hsing kang shang pao ( hong kong commercial daily ) news reporter who was waiting outside .
at the request of the reporter , xiong ziren discussed his views on the npc session .
xiong ziren noted that premier zhu rongji 's realistic , pragmatic and inspiring report embodies deng xiaoping theory and shows the determination , courage and insight of the chinese government in sticking to the road of socialism with chinese characteristics .
he said : from premier zhu rongji 's report , we can see that china has accumulated rich experience in running the country .
on the taiwan question , xiong ziren said : taiwan is an alienable part of china 's sacred territory and no attempt to split the country and promote taiwan independence can be tolerated .
we are closely watching the developments of the taiwan situation , and the pla is in full battle array .
xiong ziren 's advice to taiwan compatriots was that choosing independence would bring disaster because it meant choosing war .
he said : the chinese government has made it clear that it will not sit idle .
the chinese people will not let it happen . the pla is duty - bound to fulfill its sacred mission in protecting china 's unification and national interests .
we have the determination , the confidence , the ability and the means to protect hong kong 's security and maintain hong kong 's prosperity stability while resolving the taiwan question . hong kong compatriots can set their mind at rest .
enterprises ' transformation accelerates most of china 's existing enterprises will face the problem of having to accelerate their transformation when the time comes .
upon its wto accession , china 's markets will be affected too .
although china has made progress with its market - oriented reforms , and in some sectors especially , the markets are quite well - developed , its overall market development is still a problem .
impact on economic structure in view of the impending wto accession , china 's current economic structure will be affected . this is especially true with respect to the industrial structure , enterprise structure , and the product - mix .
with respect to the product - mix , it is clear that the social goods in general are of low quality . whether we are talking about the production facilities or the everyday goods themselves , they are of low standard and are redundant .
changing the government 's economic management mode relative to the market and the economic structure , the government 's economic management mode is much more susceptible to the impact of the country 's wto entry .
the most direct example is that the government is anxious about the consequences of the country 's wto entry but society as a whole is not .
reform is incontrovertible it is exactly because china will face intense competition and challenges after its wto entry that it must follow through with its reforms during its economic development .
it is only right to say that " reform is incontrovertible " in the course of china 's economic development . china must undergo radical economic reform , but this reform is not complete because it is an on - going process .
at this stage , china 's reform must plant its foothold in three places : first , china 's industrial base is its agricultural foundation .
as far as the social organizations are concerned , enterprises are the base .
this is because although families are the natural foundation , society 's wealth is created by enterprises .
only if we recognize this point can we change today 's abnormal situation of enterprises revolving around the government . instead , the government should revolve around , and serve , enterprises to create the conditions for enterprise development .
reform should also plant its foothold on the county towns ' economy .
this is because in china 's regional division , the county towns ' economic structure is relatively complete . but in the last decade or so , reform basically has revolved around the big cities and large enterprises .
compared with the international general practice , there is a certain room for issuing state bonds .
this exposition which involves the development of china 's financial policy in the early period of next century has aroused the attention of people at home and abroad who care for china 's economic prospects .
economic observers here pointed out : this report has disclosed four major points of information on the development of china 's financial policy .
first , two years of practices and theoretical explorations proved that " no big risks would appear " in the pro - active fiscal policy . it will not trigger inflation or debt crises to the chinese government . this has become the consensus of all government departments .
second , beginning 1 january this year , the overall growth rate of the army 's wages and allowances will increase by 30 percent over that of last year , and based on this , an increase of another 20 percent will appear this year .
third , the state finance will regulate the relations of income distribution .
china will take into account the collection of inheritance tax , gradually raise the wages of personnel such as public functionaries , and study and formulate policies for increasing wages .
fourth , china will strengthen the management of finance and taxation and consolidate the financial and economic order .
one thing that merits our attention is that the state council and some authorized units will send general accountants to large state - owned enterprises .
in this year 's financial report , the financial minister emphatically pointed out that " viewed from the practical needs of the current national economic development , the pro - active fiscal policy needs to be further implemented . "
this shows that " unswervingly implementing the pro - active fiscal policy " has become the consensus of the central authorities as well as all government departments . this has set the keynote for the orientation of the fiscal policy for the early period of the next century .
the budgetary financial deficit of the central finance this year is 229.9 billion yuan . it is expected that state bonds valued at 100 billion yuan will be issued and that there be will room for issuing more bonds .
then , will the " big deficit " policy implemented for several years running trigger inflation and lead the chinese government to a debt crisis ?
last year 's central financial deficit reached 179.7 billion yuan . it seems that this year 's financial deficits will " rise dramatically . " in fact , the rise in deficit is not caused by the implementation of the pro - active fiscal policy .
however , if calculated in terms of last year 's standards , the central financial deficits of this year will be 155 billion yuan , a decline of 24.7 billion yuan from the previous year .
economic observers here made an analysis and pointed out that in addition to the continued implementation of the essential pro - active fiscal policy , there are also some objective conditions .
the current financial deficit and debt scales are still controlled within the warning line .
the deficit in 1999 accounted for 2.8 percent or so of the gdp , which was lower than the level of the world - acknowledged warning line .
therefore , we still have room for issuing bonds .
as for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning . the debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .
in his report , xiang huaicheng has also attached great importance to the question of paying attention to the scales of state bonds and deficits .
he said : the ministry of finance has all along " strictly monitored the financial operational trend and paid attention to guarding against financial risks . "
an expert from the ministry of finance made an analysis and pointed out : in ordinary time , financial risks , including banking risks , can absolutely be avoided and effectively be controlled .
however , if major incident occurs suddenly and affects china 's credit , then the risks will be very big .
in the financial expenditures in 2000 , major breakthroughs should be made in the following five fields : first , continue to strengthen the building of infrastructures .
second , energetically support reform and development of state - owned enterprises .
third , increase social security input and comprehensively implement the policy for readjusting the distribution of income issued in 1999 .
fourth , vigorously increase educational , scientific , technological and agricultural inputs , and ensure that these inputs will increase at a rate that is higher than the growth rate of regular income .
fifth , appropriately increase expenditures on state security .
under the arrangements , the budgetary expenditure on national defense this year is 120.5 billion yuan , up 12.7 percent over the previous year . the growth rate in this field is the same as that of 1999 .
what merits our attention is that the increased amount of funds this time will be mainly used for raising the wages and allowances for military officers and men and for the expenses for troops stationed in macao .
economic observers here pointed out : beginning 1 january this year , the wages and allowances of the army will increase by 30 percent .
and based on this , another 20 percent of increase will appear in their wages and allowances .
he worked as vice governor for 14 years before he assumed the job as vice chairman of the shaanxi provincial people 's congress . one of his major tasks as vice chairman is the legislature .
since then , the first thing that he and his colleagues have considered is how to formulate laws regarding the project of developing the country 's vast western region . they believe that it is necessary to promulgate laws to ensure and standardize the project .
xu shanlin said : people of various sectors in the western region , including people in shaanxi , sincerely support the project . they have put forward their suggestions , plans , or opinions .
some people said that the project should be market - oriented . some said that it is important to rely on science and technology . some said that it is important to invite talented people to participate in the project .
some said that great importance should be attached to the environmental issue while carrying out the project . according to xu shanlin , these suggestions have some merit . but the most important thing is to standardize and ensure the project with laws .
xu shanlin and 30 other npc deputies have jointly put forward a resolution entitled the " law of the prc governing economic development in the western region . "
xu shanlin said : the project has a great bearing on more than 10 provinces and several hundred million people . it is a systematic project that requires long - term efforts on the part of people of several generations .
therefore , it is an urgent need to enact a law to guarantee the project . besides , the project is not only a matter for people living in the western region . the project needs the participation of people across the country .
we have used successful experiences of foreign countries as our reference . china also has accumulated many experiences in carrying out development and enacting law .
based on such a foundation , we are absolutely capable of enacting a law governing the development of the western region .
in this way , we can carry out the project in an even more orderly , healthy , and effective manner .
smuggling activities undermine normal economic order in the country , causing huge economic losses .
the smuggling syndicate corrupted a handful of local officials with illicit money obtained from smuggling , having an adverse effect on fujian and xiamen .
reports by some overseas newspapers which do not understand the actual situation are irresponsible .
chen noted that the fujian provincial cpc committee and the provincial government all along have been in unison with the central authorities in the crackdown against smuggling ; once smuggling activities are uncovered , they will resolutely stem them .
speaking on the economic impact of the " yuanhua case " on fujian , chen mingyi said that the crackdown on smuggling is only of benefit to fujian 's economic development , and without any disadvantage .
last year , fujian 's gdp rose 10 percent over the previous year , while xiamen 's gdp shot up 14.8 percent .
third , giving full play to the exemplary role of an investment zone for taiwan businessmen . fourth , speeding up the construction of the pilot zone for cross - strait agricultural cooperation .
fifth , stepping up pilot direct shipping and exploring the possibility of direct passenger shipping .
second , continuing to strengthen their scientific and technological exchanges .
third , continuing to expand their academic exchanges . fourth , continuing their cultural and art exchanges .
as of the end of last year , fujian approved an aggregate of 5,894 taiwan - funded enterprises , with a contractual investment of $ 10.989 billion , and $ 8 billion already in use .
some 40,000 taiwan people traveled to fujian to take part in 1,371 exchange projects , while 3,870 mainlanders went to taiwan to participate in 705 exchange projects .
this directive introduces an important task the whole party 's ideological and political education .
marked by the party 's third plenary meeting of the 11th party congress , our country entered a new historical development period of reform , opening up and construction of socialist modernization .
our country 's economic construction and overall national power as well as the people 's lives have improved by a great level .
" we tell stories about events happening in spring , we become wealthy after reform and opening up . "
this song , which is popular in both south and north of the chang jiang river , is a vivid portrayal of our country 's great historical changes .
chinese people would have groped in the dark for a longer period but for the guidance of mao zedong thought . if this is the truth , we would possibly have struggled in poverty for a longer period but for the guidance of deng xiaoping theory .
people must have a certain spirit .
when people fall into poverty , they often have a strong desire to extricate themselves from poverty .
the saying " people wish for changes when they are poor " shows a spirit , an ambition and their awareness .
at the same time , people are often satisfied with their situations . this is proved by the saying , " people become stable when they are a little wealthy . "
so " one should strive for progress after becoming wealthy " is a better spirit , ambition and awareness and is more commendable .
however , compared with some developed countries , their wealth can only be considered " little wealth . " moreover , our country has a vast territory and a large population . its development is very unbalanced .
some areas have not totally shaken off poverty . we have a long way to go before achieving our goal of becoming wealthy together . we also have to see that becoming wealthy is a process that never stops developing .
at no time can we stand still , refuse to make progress or become complacent with our current situations .
instead , we should press forward with keen determination and make unremitting efforts to improve ourselves .
an area and an individual should act like this . a country and a nation should act like this even more .
especially in the current world , new technological revolutions are developing rapidly , market competition is becoming increasingly fierce , international politics is facing a changeable situation and the challenges we face are urgent and severe .
doing well ideological and political work is an excellent tradition of our party and our military .
in wartime , we launched the education campaign of " recalling the bitterness inflicted on the laboring people by the old society and reactionaries and checking soldiers class , work and fighting will " and greatly enhanced troops cohesiveness and fighting power .
people 's understanding always has a process of deepening from the perceptual stage to the rational stage , from specific cases to general cases and from detailed to abstract .
if our reasons are detailed , our education will become deep , effective , timely , close to the people who receive the education and targeted at real problems .
achievements made in the year 1999 are historically splendid .
at the turn of the millennium , when recalling the past and looking into the future , we feel an upsurge of emotion and are filled with pride and enthusiasm .
because forces for the independence of taiwan and for separating the mainland and taiwan cling obstinately to their course , the great cause of uniting the motherland features more acute conflicts and a more complicated situation .
the pla has been an importance force for socialist revolution and construction .
we must conscientiously study and deeply understand the strategic significance in striving to develop western china .
the pla should be out in front of the whole society in the aspect of the construction of socialist civilization .
the dawn of the new century will appear in the eastern horizon .
the " large - scale development of china 's western region " is a central issue at the ongoing third session of the ninth cppcc committee .
people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and democratic parties should make their due contribution to the work .
people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and democratic parties have a galaxy of talent , enjoy an intelligence advantage , have extensive social connections , and can play an important role in the large - scale development of the western region .
the central committee of the revolutionary committee of the chinese kuomintang has sent several inspection groups to the northwest , held symposiums for experts and scholars , and submitted five motions to the cppcc committee concerning the large - scale development of the western region .
the western region is at the upper - and middle - reaches of china 's major rivers , and accelerating the building of the ecological environment in the western region is therefore of a decisive significance to china 's sustainable development , he indicated .
just he did seven time previously when he came to beijing to attend the npc sessions , the imam from kashi 's aitigaer mosque would pray five time daily in a room at the session venue .
he told the reporters : " china 's current policy on religion is the best . "
the 68 - year - old shahtik has been elected npc deputy for two consecutive terms . with a long gray beard and a dark - green embroidered cap on his head , he wore black kashi - made leather boots .
he said : " china implements a policy where people are free in religious beliefs : people are free to believe or not to believe in religion .
the government protects the legitimate rights and interests of all the religious believers . "
shahtik is vice chairman of the xinjiang kashi prefectural islamic association .
in an exclusive interview with reporters , legqog , chairman of the tibet autonomous regional government , who is another deputy from minor nationalities , said : the government fully respects the masses ' freedom in religious beliefs .
commenting on the allegations of some people abroad with ulterior motives that tibet does not have freedom in religious beliefs , he said : " it is utter nonsense ! "
he said : we can see people offer joss sticks to the buddha everywhere in lhasa and other parts of tibet .
as of now , tibet has over 1,700 tibetan buddhist temples , over 300 more than the figure in 1951 when tibet was first liberated peacefully .
the tibet autonomous regional legislative organs also incorporated tibetan traditional festivals , including " tibetan calendar new year " and the " xuetun festival [ name as transliterated ] , " as public holidays in the tibet autonomous region .
legqog said : since china carried out reform and opening up , the state has allocated and used over 300 million yuan and a lot of gold and silver to repair and protect tibetan temples .
the potala palace has also been listed by the un educational , scientific , and cultural organization as " part of the world 's cultural heritage . "
he said : in 2000 , tibet will continually repair the potala palace and other temples including xigaze 's salka temple [ name as transliterated ] , which is a unit for cultural protection at the national level .
tong fu , vice chairman of the npc standing committee foreign affairs committee , who recently accompanied a foreign delegation to visit tibet , said : " the best way is to let foreigners personally see the actual tibet themselves .
over there , you can see that the temples are very well kept . people are not restricted in religious beliefs . "
a responsible official of the state council 's state bureau of religious affairs said : at present , china has over 100 million religious believers , including buddhists , moslems , and catholics with over 85,000 various religious centers .
beijing , 7 mar ( xinhua ) - - today is the " 8 march " international working women 's day .
we extend holiday greetings to women of all nationalities and circles throughout the country , to female compatriots in hong kong and macao special administrative regions , to female compatriots in taiwan , and to female compatriots overseas !
ninety years ago , the second international socialist women 's conference established 8 march as international working women 's day .
throughout these 90 years , with the rise of national liberation movements , hundreds of millions of women of all races and nationalities have struggled hard relentlessly for their own liberation and for mankind 's progress , creating glorious chapters in women 's liberation movements .
the founding of new china , in a radical way , eradicated the economic foundation and class division that had led to suppression and bullying of women . women in our country have won enormous liberation and have actively devoted themselves to the great undertaking of socialist construction .
the great practice of women 's movement in china tells us that women , who make up half of the population , play an important role in national construction , and are drivers of social progress and creators of material wealth and spiritual civilization .
at the fourth world conference on women , president jiang zemin solemnly pointed out the need to make seeking gender equality a basic national policy in china 's social development .
liberation and development of women in china has formed an important part of the drive of seeking equality and development by women throughout the world and has won praise from around the world .
we are about to enter a new century filled with opportunities and challenges . the magnificent undertaking of rejuvenating china requires the people of all nationalities throughout the country , including women , to struggle courageously in a pioneering manner .
beijing , 7 march ( xinhua ) - - opinion makers universally maintained : after china joins the world trade organization [ wto ] , its economy will face stern challenges .
to meet the new challenges china may face in its bid to enter the wto , gao shangquan , president of the chinese research society for restructuring economic system , proposed here today six countermeasures .
gao shangquan proposed speeding up the pace of reform and opening up to the outside world to meet the challenges mentioned above .
for this he proposed six countermeasures . they include : 1 . to create a micro - basis for a market economy and increase the competitiveness of enterprises , with the stress on making a strategic readjustment of the state - owned economy .
industries where production capacity is excessive should be diverted , through assets displacement and reorganization , to the public sector or new industries , which the government should strengthen .
enterprises that suffer serious losses in operation , with their assets short of paying their debts , and do not have a promising future for development should be ordered to go bankrupt according to the law . 2 .
to speed up financial reform to ensure a comparatively high growth of the economy .
presently , in addition to continuing expanding government expenditures , attention should be paid to the proper readjustment of the expenditure structure and proper coordination of financial revenue and expenditure in terms of role and orientation . 3 .
to speed up the development of the western region of china and the process of urbanization , in a bid to boost a coordinated development of regional economies as well as urban and rural economies .
to accelerate reform of the government 's administrative structure and gradually improve the legal foundation for a market economy . 5 .
to vigorously implement the strategy of developing the nation with science and technology and education so as to accelerate industrial upgrading .
the government 's input in r & d [ research and development ] should be increased by a wide margin .
to continue implementing the opening - up policy in a firm , active , and steady manner .
before liberalizing trade , efforts should be made to stabilize the macro economy and improve the balance of international payments and before the renminbi is made freely convertible , efforts should be made to solve the issue of bad loans in large quantities facing banks .
only in this way can we make the most of the development opportunities to be brought about by china 's wto entry and minimize its pounding effect .
while entering the hong kong pavilion , a smiling li peng joined his hands together , saluting the participating deputies , and the latter greeted him with warm applause in return .
li peng said that he was very pleased to discuss and examine the government work report today with the hong kong deputies and he expressed hope that all participants would speak out and say what they want to say to him .
deputy rita fan [ fan hsu li - tai ] was the first to speak .
she made suggestions on how to strengthen environmental protection and achieve sustainable development while developing the economy .
deputy wu ching - hui said : on the issue of corruption , effective measures should be adopted and effective supervision in various forms should be strengthened .
he proposed speeding up the enactment of a " press law " and effectively guaranteeing the supervisory role of the media .
deputy huang yi - hung said : the development of the knowledge economy and the internet has changed the world rapidly . he proposed adopting effective measures to ward off and alleviate financial risks so as to ensure economic security and network security .
deputy fei pei offered suggestions and expectations on the npc 's work toward foreign countries .
he said : the work toward foreign countries of the current npc has made successes , including innovative advances . for instance , hong kong and macao representatives were included in bilateral friendship groups with foreign parliaments , and very good results have been achieved in this regard .
she proposed summing up and popularizing all these practices . deputy wen chia - hsuan spoke on the implementation of the hong kong basic law . the npc standing committee 's interpretation of the relevant provisions of the basic law last year was entirely correct and most authoritative .
he also made suggestions on the popularization and implementation of the basic law .
deputy cheng teh - cheng said : since hong kong 's return to the motherland , under the guidance of the " one country , two systems " policy , the cooperative relations between hong kong and the inland has been substantially upgraded .
he proposed improving the legal system , strengthening the supervision by the npc , promoting constant improvement of the inland 's investment environment , and expanding cooperation between hong kong and the inland .
after attentively listening to the delegates ' speeches , li peng aired his views .
he said : two years or so have elapsed since hong kong 's return to the motherland . facts have proven that the practice of the great concept of " one country , two systems " in hong kong is successful and full of vitality .
" one country " and " two systems " are inseparable . we must have a comprehensive and correct understanding of this truth .
the basic law embodies both " one country " and " two systems , " with the final interpretation right resting with the npc standing committee .
he emphatically pointed out : the npc is very cautious in exercising the right to interpret the basic law .
li peng agreed with some hong kong deputies who proposed carrying out active inter - parliamentary exchanges .
he said : inter - parliamentary exchanges are a key component of china 's diplomacy .
the npc has set up bilateral friendship groups with parliaments of more than 50 foreign countries . the figure may increase in the days to come .
to include hong kong deputies into these groups is a way for them to take part in the administration of state affairs .
through inter - parliamentary contacts and exchanges , foreign parliamentarians would very often air their new views on china and this is very helpful to us .
he hoped that hong kong deputies would speak out what they want to say , discuss state affairs with other deputies , and make greater contributions to the country .
hong kong delegation head wu kang - min presided over today 's discussion meeting , which was attended by he chunlin , secretary general of the npc standing committee .
the third session of the ninth cppcc committee held its first session for members to air their views in the great hall of the people this afternoon .
a total of 12 cppcc members gave their constructive views and made suggestions on such major issues as reform , opening up , economic construction , and a sustainable development .
li ruihuan , member of the political bureau standing committee of the cpc central committee and chairman of the cppcc , attended today 's meeting .
today 's meeting was noted mainly for the offering of constructive advice and suggestions by economists , and for the discussion of state affairs by political parties and groups .
member dong fureng , well - known economist and honorary director of the institute of economics under the chinese academy of social sciences , spoke on the issue of using the finance to pull along the economy .
in his speech , member lin yifu , director of the research center on china 's economy under beijing university , expressed hope that the country can further lift its control over taiwan investment , so as to accelerate the reunification process of the motherland .
he suggested that taiwan businessmen be given " citizen 's treatments " and be allowed to run any industry and trade that a chinese citizen is allowed to run by legal means .
the fields which are to be opened to foreign investment as agreed by china upon its accession to the wto should first be opened to taiwan businessmen .
meanwhile , we should also work hard to create a sound legal environment for the investment and the business operation of taiwan businessmen .
the present year is the first year of macao 's return to the motherland .
the executive chairmen of today 's meeting were ye xuanping , ngapoi ngawang jigme , song jian , qian zhengying , zhu guangya , wan guoquan , zhao nanqi , jing shuping , and zhang kehui .
zhu bangzao said : china 's defense budget for this year is 120.5 billion yuan .
although this is an increase in absolute terms , china is still among the countries with the lowest per capita expenditures .
the spokesman said : this year 's increased defense expenditures will mainly cover the increases in salaries and allowances for officers and soldiers in the armed forces , the costs of housing reform , medical insurance , and the expenditures for troops stationed in macao .
moreover , the central government will budget an additional 5.6 billion yuan to cover the expenses that the military and the armed police force will need to perform their functions , as they no longer engage in business operations .
he said : china 's defense construction is firmly subordinate to and serves the overall interests of national economic construction .
this is china 's long - term basic policy .
the spokesman reiterated that an early realization of china 's reunification is the common desire of all chinese people , including the taiwan compatriots .
he pointed out : the government and people of china firmly oppose us arms sales to taiwan , as well as the supply by the united states to taiwan of the theater missile defense system and related technology , equipment , and auxiliary systems .
this stand of china 's is firm and unshakable [ jian ding bu yi de 1017 1353 0008 4448 4104 ] .
he said : lee teng - hui 's acts of going to foreign countries , in whatever capacity , to carry out political activities of creating " two chinas " will be opposed and condemned by the chinese government and the chinese people .
he said : china has all along advocated that lebanon 's sovereign rights and territorial integrity should be respected and that israel should implement the un security council 's resolution no. 425 and withdraw from southern lebanon .
the total issue of treasury bonds this year will reach 438 billion yuan , 26.5 billion yuan more than last year . the chinese government is trying to increase domestic demand and promote economic development through fiscal input .
some doubt whether china can put up with growing deficits and government debts and are worried about possible risks .
xiang huaicheng 's clear answer to these skeptics is : practice and theoretical explorations over the past two years have proved that the proactive fiscal policy involves no major risks and will not trigger inflation or a debt crisis .
the implementation of the proactive fiscal policy has protected social stability , maintained the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy , and improved the people 's living standards although it has also increased deficits and debts .
this is a price the government has to pay exercising macro - control of the economy . it is worth it .
although china 's economy has been operating well in recent years , the problem of insufficient effective demand has also been quite pronounced .
in view of this , the chinese government resolutely adopted the important decision of increasing domestic demand to boost economic growth .
economists taking part in the two sessions believe that the implementation of a proactive fiscal policy is the most direct and effective means of increasing domestic demand .
in terms of the effects of financing through government bonds , the 210 billion yuan of long - term bonds issued by the government through banks over the past two years only made use of some of the savings deposits .
the rate of economic growth fueled by government bonds alone amounted to 1.5 percentage points in 1998 and two percentage points in 1999 .
the government no longer talks about " a moderately tight fiscal and monetary policy " in its fiscal report this year . a moderate increase in money supply has in fact dispelled worries that fiscal deficit will trigger inflation .
as long as china can maintain rapid economic growth and continue to optimize its economic structure and achieve better economic results , the government 's repayment ability can still be guaranteed .
according to last year 's method , the forecast central budget deficit this year should be 24.7 billion yuan less than the actual deficit last year .
according to the report on the national economic and social development plan delivered by state planning commission minister zeng peiyuan , china 's economic growth rate is expected to reach about seven percent this year .
in order to achieve the economic growth targets , it is of the utmost importance that we maintain a fast rate of investment growth .
deputies to the npc and cppcc members are of the view that this year 's proactive fiscal policy has become the consensus of the central authorities and all government departments . they believe that this policy will continue to promote the beneficial growth of china 's economy .
beijing , 7 mar (zts) - - the year 2000 is the last year , as well as a decisive year to realize the three - year goal of reforming state - owned enterprises and getting them out of their plight .
sheng huaren , minister of the state economic and trade commission , said today that this goal will certainly be attained .
sheng huaren said at today 's press conference that last year , state - owned enterprises noticeably improved economic efficiency .
as a breakthrough point to carry out reform and eliminate poverty , state - owned textile enterprises created 800 million yuan in profits last year , putting an end to the money - losing situation for six consecutive years .
of the country 's 31 provinces , regions , and municipalities , 21 either increased profits or halted deficits .
sheng huaren pointed out that this year , we should do our best to fulfill the three - year goal of reforming state - owned enterprises and getting them out of their plight .
in 1999 , state - owned enterprises laid off 11.74 million workers and the registered urban unemployment rate was 3.1 percent .
zhang tzoji reported on the basic situation of labor and social security and answered reporters ' questions at a news conference today .
he said : we will strive to help more unemployed workers find jobs than the total number of new layoffs this year . it is necessary for the state to provide basic needs to a monthly average of 6.5 million to 7 million laid - off workers .
he pointed out : this year 's work will focus on guaranteeing basic livelihood and promoting reemployment .
first , we will seriously implement the " three - third " fund - raising principle [ splitting the cost between enterprises , society and government ] and earnestly guarantee the basic needs of laid - off workers .
while ensuring that the enterprises and the society raise their shares of the funds , the governments at all levels will readjust their spending plan , include the funds for guaranteeing the basic needs of laid - off workers in their budget , and practice fiscal transparency .
the central authorities will continue to give financial support to the central and western regions and to old industrial bases .
second , we will make greater efforts to help laid - off workers find jobs .
on the premise of maintaining a certain economic growth rate , we will make great efforts to create more jobs by developing the tertiary industry , particularly the community service industry .
we will strive to implement well all the preferential policies that help create jobs .
we will carry out well job skill training to enhance the laid - off workers ' ability of finding new jobs .
third , we will improve the unemployment insurance system , step up the building of labor market , promote the creation of a market - oriented employment mechanism , and keep the urban unemployment rate below 3.5 percent .
they pledged one after another to conscientiously study and grasp this exposition and guide their thinking and actions with it in order to advance the cause of building socialism with chinese characteristics in an all - round way .
to make the country strong and the people rich is the starting point and the final goal of all the work of the party .
while studying this speech by comrade jiang zemin , party members and cadres in shanghai 's industrial departments felt : comrade jiang zemin 's speech has struck a chord in the hearts of people , which is a tremendous encouragement for party members and cadres .
now the reform of state - owned enterprises has entered the stage of surmounting the most serious difficulties , and this is a crucial period for development . the three - way " representing " exposition is of great practical and guiding significance .
to represent the requirements for the development of the advanced productive forces , we should carry out economic construction as the central task and concentrate on the development of the productive forces .
this is the way to achieve success , which has been proved by the practice of reform and opening up over the past 20 - odd years .
zheng mingli , secretary of the party committee of the nanchang railway bureau , said : as the vanguard of the working class , the cpc plays a leading role in state - owned enterprises .
in the present age , we communists should take the improvement and development of the productive forces as our own duty and vigorously carry out reform in order to better represent the requirements for the development of the advanced productive forces in china .
in the new historical period , we should uphold and implement the party 's basic line and accelerate economic development and social progress .
whether a party , country , or nation represents the orientation for the progress of an advanced culture will determine the quality , ability , and rise or decline of the party , country , or nation .
when an area is backward economically , it has no status ; when a culture is backward , it has no quality .
in recent years , baishan city has been making efforts to build itself into a " culturally rich city " in which photography , painting , handicraft , radio , television , and other cultural undertakings have been developing rapidly .
in recent years , we have achieved remarkable results in given full scope to the central theme of our times while advocating diversity .
the general secretary 's three - way " representing " exposition means looking at culture according new historical conditions and the basic nature of the party , which is bound to guide the direction for all - round progress in the motherland .
to better represent the orientation for the progress of china 's advanced culture , the party should make vigorous efforts to promote the study of science and cultural knowledge and the development of science and cultural undertakings .
without an accumulation of scientific and cultural knowledge , it will be impossible to scale the heights of science or the heights of ideology and morality ; in that case , china would not be able to advance ahead of the times .
reconstructing dilapidated one - story housing , bringing qiangzi river under control , and rebuilding the heping road are all projects that benefit the people and enjoy immense popular support .
thus , large numbers of residents of the municipality have highly spoken of the communist party and socialism one after another .
following the third plenary session of the 11th cpc central committee , a contracted responsibility system with remuneration linked to output was implemented , various kinds of enterprises were set up , and nanzhuang village became the only better - off village in henan 's extremely poor county .
the earth - shaking changes were brought about in our village under the guidance of the party 's policy and through the efforts of the masses . this fully proves that the cpc faithfully represents the fundamental interests of the people .
in developing the market economy , party organizations and party members should give full play to their respective roles as a fighting citadel and a file leader .
by so doing , the masses will follow us , party organizations will be able to rally multitudes at a single call and will be full of creativity and fighting capacity .
beijing , 7 mar (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today that china and india would hold their first security dialogue at the department or bureau level in beijing , in accordance with the consensus reached by their foreign ministers .
zhu bangzao said : as major powers in asia , china and india bear important responsibility for maintaining regional peace and stability .
the conduct of security dialogue will help enhance mutual understanding between the two countries , expand consensus between the two sides , and promote cooperation in relevant areas .
on the question of nuclear weapons in south asia , he said that china believes india should comprehensively and seriously implement un security council 's resolution no. 1172 .
on israeli 's withdrawal of its troops from lebanon , zhu bangzao said : china expresses its appreciation of israel 's decision .
china has always maintained that lebanon 's sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and that israel should implement un security council 's resolution no. 425 and withdraw its troops from southern lebanon .
he said : china hopes that the move will help promote overall progress in the middle east peace talks and achieve peace and stability in the middle east at an early date .
at the panel discussion , six cppcc members made speeches , respectively . they set forth opinions on the government work report and the cppcc work .
they maintained that last year , the government and the cppcc made noticeable achievements in their work , and the achievements were gratifying and pressed the people to advance bravely .
janabil , chairman of the cppcc xinjiang uygur autonomous regional committee ; and ma sizhong , chairman of the cppcc ningxia hui nationality autonomous regional committee , set forth opinions on the large - scale development of the western areas .
after hearing the cppcc members ' speeches , li ruihuan gave a speech .
he said that the cppcc is an organization for consultation . consultation is the cppcc 's main function and major work method .
the cpc leaders of the three generations all have attached full importance to the cppcc 's consultative function and urged to achieve such a kind of consultation .
fundamentally speaking , consultation is a kind of discussion .
practice shows that when we come across a question , discussions are better than non - discussions , more discussions are better than fewer discussions , and quick discussions are better than late discussions .
li ruihuan said that one person 's practice and understanding have limitation , in general .
a leader is wise not because he is smarter than others , but because he is good at learning from others and at pooling , understanding , and generalizing increasingly more people 's practice , experience , intelligence , and wisdom .
therefore , leaders must consult with the masses when meeting questions . pooling the wisdom of the masses in the course of discussions is the fundamental way for avoiding mistakes and ceaselessly making progress .
li ruihuan pointed out that holding discussions means accepting different opinions .
discovering and absorbing beneficial things from others ' opinions is the starting point and our purpose to hold discussions .
without democratic workstyle and without an open - minded attitude toward others , it is impossible to achieve good results .
to do a good job on discussions , we should treat others equally and sincerely .
equality is the basis for discussions . with equality , we will be able to create an atmosphere for mutual respect and harmony and to have others directly express their opinions , talk freely , and set forth all kinds of opinions and proposals .
sincerity is the prerequisite for discussions . so long as we sincerely treat others and speak honestly will we able to hear true and frank words from others .
li ruihuan emphatically concluded that the question of whether communist party members pay attention to and achieve discussions is by no means a minor matter .
li ruihuan urged the communist party members in the cppcc organizations to cultivate the habit of discussing questions and strive to be experts in the united front work and the cppcc work .
ye xuanping , yang rudai , wang zhaoguo , song jian , li guixian , chen junsheng , zhang siqing , qian zhengying , zhu guangya , hu qili , chen jinhua , zhao nanqi , mao zhiyong , and bai lichen attended the panel discussion .
during discussions with gansu and ningxia delegations , zhu rongji gave opinions mainly on the extensive development of the western region .
he said : the central authorities ' proposal of implementing the strategy of extensively developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions has won the support of the whole nation and drawn the attention of the world .
the central and western regions are facing an unprecedented development opportunity . it is hoped that all of you would firmly grasp this historical opportunity and be fully prepared in terms of thoughts , organizations and actions .
we should be farsighted , make our work keep abreast of development , set a higher starting point , and strive to make all fields of work enter a new stage , attain a new level , and see new progress .
during discussions with the gansu and heilongjiang delegations , zhu rongji touched on the issue of expanding opening up under the new situation .
he said : over the past 20 years , china has opened up its coastal regions of guangdong and fujian and unceasingly spread its efforts to the vast inland areas , scored achievements of worldwide attention and accumulated valuable experiences .
with the acceleration of the process of china 's accession to the world trade organization , china has been faced with new situation , opportunities and challenges in opening up to the outside world .
we should seize the opportunity and further expand opening up with a braver posture and more effective measures in an effort to raise the chinese economy 's international competitiveness and the capacity to resist risks and accelerate the progress of modernization .
zhu rongji also stressed : it is necessary to make earnest efforts to strengthen the ideological education of the broad masses of cadres , strengthen socialist spiritual civilization construction , and ensure the sound development of opening up .
the delegates of taiwan province gave an enthusiastic response to the expositions carried in the government work report on the settlement of the taiwan issue and the realization of the great reunification cause of the motherland .
they showed resolute support , one after another , for the chinese government 's adherence to the principled stand of one china , and for its move to adopt all measures possible in order to safeguard the country 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the delegates noted : as taiwan compatriots , we have a greater sense of urgency and a greater sense of mission on the settlement of the taiwan issue .
the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems " tallies with the maximum interests of all the chinese people , including taiwan compatriots ; and is therefore the best solution to the taiwan issue .
the delegates also expressed hope that their loved ones on the island can make a careful choice for the safety and well - being of taiwan and themselves .
qian qichen spoke after hearing the views of the delegates .
he noted : after the successive returns of hong kong and macao to the embrace of the motherland , the task of settling the taiwan issue and realizing a complete unification of the motherland has been emphatically placed before all chinese .
the white paper on " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue , " which is published this year , has reiterated the consistent stand of the chinese government on the settlement of the taiwan issue , and has evoked strong repercussions both at home and abroad .
our stand against an indefinite delay on the settlement of the taiwan issue has been consistent , noted qian qichen .
" taiwan independence " forces and separatist force , as well as foreign anti - china forces , all hope to put off the settlement of the taiwan issue indefinitely .
this is something that we cannot tolerate .
he added : the concept of " one country , two systems " has been successfully practiced in hong kong and macao , and is also totally applicable to the settlement of the taiwan issue .
taiwan compatriots enjoy a glorious patriotic tradition , and we sincerely place hopes on the vast numbers of the taiwan people .
i believe that the taiwan people will surely make a correct choice on issues that have a vital importance on sovereignty and territorial integrity , on the fundamental interest of the chinese nation , and on the future and fate of taiwan .
with the common efforts of the people on both sides of the taiwan straits , the taiwan issue can surely be settled at an early date .

in his respective speech to the two delegations , qian qichen again reiterated the consistent stand of the chinese government on settling the taiwan issue in line with the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems . "
wen jiabao said : the development of xinjiang involves the overall economy of the whole country , and is of important meaning in terms of consolidating the border areas , developing the economy and culture of minority groups , and enhancing the unity of all ethnic groups .
wen jiabao said : xinjiang , with vast land and abundant resources , has an advantage in resource exploration .
the gas in xinjiang will become the most important succeeding resource for our state . the to - be - implemented project of " transferring gas from west to east " will be able to transfer 1.2 million tonnes of natural gas to the east every year .
the coal reserve of xinjiang is also abundant , and is very promising for resource exploration .
he said : in the aspect of infrastructure , besides accelerating the building of railways , highways , and communications , xinjiang should also make great efforts to develop aviation , the aviation within the autonomous region in particular .
he also noted that all major cases , whichever department and whoever they may involve , should be investigated thoroughly and completely ; and no one is allowed to show partiality or be soft in the handling of such cases .
the section on the anti - corruption work in zhu rongji 's report won the warm applause of all the delegates attending the meeting .
according to an expert , during the initial years of china 's reform and opening up , corrupt practices started to emerge among a number of cadres , which was regarded as the cost of reform .
the year 1992 , however , could be seen as a watershed : prior to 1992 , corruption practices , which were resulted from frictions of the then double - track pricing system , were scattered and isolated , involving small amounts of money .
meanwhile , the total number of officials at the prefectural - departmental level who have been given disciplinary punishment within the party and the government for corrupt practices has presented a shocking figure .
china 's top leadership has taken the problem of corruption seriously , and has approached the anti - corruption struggle from the high plane that it has a vital importance to " the very existence " of the ruling party .
however , why are the criminal practices of corruption still spreading rampantly in the country instead of being checked ?
this has made the common people doubt as whether corruption can ever be prevented in real terms .
professor yan qiang held that introducing a political structural reform is the greatest mission for this npc session and the coming several sessions , for only in this way can corruption be eliminated and prevented in terms of system .
he also indicated : there existed some errors in our fight against corruption in the past , for people tended to lay an excessive stress on punishment to the neglect of the system building .
some jurists attending the " two sessions " believed that the struggle against corrupt practices should start with the implementation of the following five systems : first of all , a strict professional qualifications system should be established , which is also known as the deprival system .
under this system , any state civil servant who is found to have been involved in any undesired activities should be deprived of his professional qualifications as a civil servant , even if his error have yet to lead to any serious consequences , for overindulgence will nurture evil .
in recent years , a number of large cities have experimented with the practice of recruiting from the society cadres at the associate departmental - bureau level , and practice has showed that most of these cadres have attained gratifying achievements in their career .
now that rural areas have already possessed the necessary conditions for such practice , we should go on to spread the practice to townships , counties , and cities .
meanwhile , instead of engaging ourselves in a nominal change , we should make use of the opportunity of a wage raise and conduct a strict appraisal on the performance of civil servants , and should optimize the personnel quality of civil servants while improving their benefits and remunerations .
over the past several years , the cpc 's decision - making leadership has constantly increased the intensity of the anti - corruption struggle , and has begun to guard against and punish corruption by first building up sound systems .
the delegates and members attending the " two sessions " in beijing this year have expressed hope that this motion can also be discussed at this year 's meeting .
at the present moment , we should attend to our work in earnest , and complete the task of drafting laws which aim to advocate honesty and oppose corruption .
li peng emphasized the need to pay attention to key points and give full scope to advantages so to achieve success in the grand development of the western region .
the deputies ' discussions today focused on the acceleration of reform and development to pave the way for the grand development of the western region . all of the deputies vied with one another to speak on the implementation of the grand development of the western region .

deputy cheng andong noted : shaanxi , as a gateway for the undertaking of developing the west , should grasp the opportunity to make substantial progress .
one the one hand , we should improve our infrastructure , and on the other hand , we should establish our own superior industries , such as accelerating the development of high - and new - technology , tourism , the fruit industry , and military industries .
it is imperative to boost the drive of returning cultivated land to forestry and reinforce environmental protection in a bid to restore the northwest region 's beautiful scenery .
deputy han wei mentioned in his speech that in developing the west , we should also pay attention to the protection of cultural relics , and integrate the protection drive with the development of tourism .

jiang zhenghua , vice chairman of the npc standing committee , also attended the meeting today .
this is the chinese government 's consistent stand . the above remarks were made by qian qichen while attending respectively the discussions of hong kong and macao delegations this afternoon .
qian qichen said : the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland and the realization of the great concept of " one country , two systems " is of great significance in realizing peaceful reunification and resolving the taiwan issue .
for more than two years , the principles and policies on " one country , two systems " have undergone a real test in hong kong , and practice proved that it is very successful .
following that , macao has also realized the great concept of " one country , two systems . " the present situation of macao is also very good .
we have every reason to believe that the future prospects of hong kong and macao will be more magnificent .
this does not mean that the chinese government has changed its policies toward taiwan . that the settlement of the taiwan issue cannot be indefinitely delayed is our consistent stance .
qian qichen pointed out : reunification is an issue concerning the righteous cause of the nation . it is hoped that compatriots in taiwan would have a fuller understanding of the " one country , two systems . "
after their return , hong kong and macao have really kept its original social systems , life styles and laws basically unchanged .
it is hoped that compatriots in taiwan would pay more visits to hong kong and macao .
qian qichen pointed out : the fact that china not committing itself to rule out the use of force is precisely beneficial to the realization of peaceful reunification .
the zhejiang and inner mongolia deputies expressed their views on the government work report in light of the realities of their own localities .
li lanqing expressed his opinions after listening attentively to the deputies ' views .
there is no doubt that we should seriously study how to reduce excessive schoolwork at middle and primary schools .
however , we must never simplify the work of strengthening the ideological and moral education for youngsters , comprehensively implementing the party 's educational principles , and carrying out an allaround quality education .
at present , some localities , with only an one - sided understanding of the " burden reduction " task , have slackened their teaching work and organization of and guidance for students ' extracurricular activities . such a phenomenon merits everyone 's attention .
buhe , vice chairman of the npc standing committee , joined the inner mongolia deputies in examining and discussing the government work report .

( end summary ) this morning cpc general secretary and president jiang zemin took part in a full - member meeting of the shanghai deputies to the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] .
the great hall of the people was full of a warm atmosphere .
focusing on the government work report , the deputies actively expressed their views in light of their local conditions .
deputy wang qifan was the first to talk about shanghai 's industrial enterprise reform and development as well as speeding up technological innovations .
as a member of the shanghai delegation , jiang zemin was very interested in shanghai 's reform and construction .
he took notes while listening and sometimes chipped in to exchange views with the deputies . he also asked them about shanghai 's reform and development .
after carefully listening to the deputies ' remarks , jiang zemin expressed his views .
he pointed out : over the last few years , shanghai has made new achievements in reform and development .
in the new century , i hope shanghai will make efforts to create new strong points , make new contributions , and take a bigger stride in being the first to basically achieve modernization .
in the course of modernization , blazing new trails by means of science and technology and blazing new trails in the economic structure are decisive factors .
by effectively distributing and utilizing knowledge and intellectual resources , we should make efforts to improve our ability of blazing new trails by means of science and technology , to constantly inject new vitality for economic and social development .
through establishing and improving the socialist market economic structure , we should bring into play our political strong points and display the creativity and initiative of cadres and masses as well as the vitality of all social circles to a maximum .
it is also necessary to continue to carry out explorations and practice in promoting state enterprise reform , in strengthening the establishment of the market system , in speeding up the transformation of government functions , and in forming the social security system .
jiang zemin pointed out : following the constant development of our economy , we should take an active part in international economic competition and make efforts to gain the initiative in this respect .
we should seize every opportunity to carry out the strategy of " going out , " closely combine " introduction from abroad " with " going out , " and utilize in a better way two kinds of resources and two kinds of markets of foreign countries .
this is the only way for us to gain the initiative in international competition .
this will help carry out an economic structural adjustment and the optimized deployment of resources in an even broader arena and will thus continuously increase china 's economic development ability and impetus and promote its long - term economic development .
in " going out , " there is a need to seek experience , work out standard regulations , strengthen management , and actively and steadily fulfill our work .
chinese territory is vast and the development of different regions is not balanced .
regions that have developed ahead of others should not forget how their prosperity has come and should think of making further progress ; they should continue to work hard and actively help and encourage those less developed regions to speed up their development .
we should observe economic rules . we should bring into play the guiding role of policies and the regulatory role of the market mechanism as well . we should actively encourage enterprises in eastern regions to participate in the development of central and western regions by various means .
in this new stage , we should , in accordance with the requirements of the " three deputies , " educate comrades in the entire party , particularly all levels of leading cadres , to comprehensively strengthen party building .
all levels of party committees and governments should profoundly study new situations and new problems in close coordination with actual conditions , carry out active explorations and practice in comprehensively strengthening party building , and constantly improve the quality of party members and the leadership level of leading cadres .
we should enable all levels of party organizations , party cadres , and party members to lead the masses always with full enthusiasm and high morale in promoting economic and social development and strengthening socialist material and spiritual civilizations .
wu bangguo , huang ju , wu jieping , and han zhubin also took part in the shanghai delegation 's meeting .
at a panel discussion this afternoon [ 3 march ] with guangdong delegates to the national people 's congress , state councilor wu yi encouraged powerful enterprises in guangdong to develop abroad .
like the development of the western region , she said , their development is conducive to china 's long - term development and its integration into the global economic system .
wu yi noted that the overseas development of powerful enterprises in processing with their own materials is an important aspect of china 's opening up to the outside world .
state enterprises and share - issuing enterprises should " go out " courageously , she said .
as to konka group 's establishment of a plant in india and a research and development base in silicon valley in the united states , wu yi expressed her appreciation .
she said that china has very good products , including quality textiles , foodstuffs , and home appliances . all localities should lay stress on promoting the sale of their products and their own enterprises .
wu yi also placed particular emphasis on personnel training and expressed her hope that guangdong will explore experience for the whole country in overseas development .
attending the panel discussion included guangdong party secretary li changchun , provincial people 's congress chairman zhu senlin , and governor lu ruihua .
during the discussion , he emphasized the need to combine honesty and self - discipline on the part of leading cadres with strict supervision .
the deputies earnestly discussed the report and spoke one after another in the light of reality . cao bochun [ 2580 0130 4783 ] said : our principle and tasks are clear .
building a contingent of high - caliber cadres is of the utmost importance to reform , opening up and modernization .
we must arm party members with deng xiaoping theory and take resolute measures to improve party style and build a clean and honest government .
efforts must be made to reform the cadre system and prevent the breeding and spread of corruption at its very roots .
lin can [ 2651 3503 ] called for efforts to change the current situation where the contributions made by science and technology to agriculture are on the low side , and promote the progress of agricultural science and technology in the light of guangxi 's actual conditions .
song jidong [ 1345 4949 2639 ] maintained that comprehensively improving management , strengthening the internal organs and achieving efficiency through better management are effective means to help state - owned enterprises turn around .
che rongfu [ 6508 2837 4395 ] discussed the need to increase people 's awareness of importance of development , energetically restructure the economy and foster new economic growth points .
after the deputies had taken the floor , wei jianxing pointed out : the three anti - corruption tasks determined by the central committee concern two issues : the rectification of unhealthy tendencies and the punishment of corrupt elements .
they directly encroach upon the interests of the broad masses , seriously affect the relations between cadres and the masses , and undermine the party 's prestige .
localities and departments where unhealthy tendencies prevail are also places where erring cadres , major cases and corrupt elements abound .
the solution of the problem of unhealthy tendencies mainly depends on honesty and self discipline on the part of leading cadres and through paying special attention to education , the system and supervision .
we must pay attention to unhealthy tendencies and self discipline and start off by grasping concrete problems .
some people think that wining and dining at public expenses , accepting red packets and having grey income are trivial issues , but these are often the areas where the corrosion of cadres begin .
we must strengthen supervision over these cadres . some of them must be subject to strict disciplinary action , which is intended to educate and help them .
years of practice shows that honesty and self - discipline on the part of leading cadres must be combined with the strict requirements , strict management and strict supervision of leading cadres by party organizations at all levels .
standards and rules of discipline introduced in recent years are by no means few , why is it that unhealthy tendencies have not shown any obvious signs of weakening ?
instead , they merely seek good relations with everyone at the expense of principles , and practice vulgar skills of establishing connections .
we should conscientiously study and implement the spirit of the important speech by general secretary jiang zemin on strictly running the party , stress study , politics and uprightness , and effectively improve the daily management and supervision of leading cadres .
we must continue to exert great efforts to carry the anti - corruption struggle to greater depths .
ding guangen , member of the political bureau and secretary of the secretariat of the cpc central committee , also attended the discussion of the guangxi delegation .
guizhou governor qian yunlu , a deputy , said in his speech that the great development of the west is very significant and presents a rare opportunity .
hu jintao discussed with the deputies the questions of transmitting power from west to east china , returning farmland to forest and pasture , and enterprise reform and development .
if it is done well the economic returns as well as the results will be good . "
after earnestly listening to the deputies ' speeches , hu jintao said , the inauguration of the strategy of great development of the west is an extremely precious opportunity for promoting china 's modernization , especially the development of the western regions , including guizhou .
guizhou must base its work on its natural conditions and socialist economic conditions in thoroughly implementing the relevant central guidelines and policies and embarking on a new path of development .
he demanded that the leading cadres at all levels profoundly appreciate and seriously implement comrade jiang zemin 's recent important instructions on party building , endeavor to enhance their ideological and political quality , and truly improve their ideological and work styles .
hu jintao said , we are carrying out the great development of the west in conditions of developing socialist market economy , and there is no ready - made experience and pattern to follow .
we can only embark on a new path by studying in the course of practice and advancing in the course of exploration .
if we stick to old conventions we will simply miss the opportunity , and we will hesitate to move forward if we fear and shrink back from difficulties .
the leading cadres at all levels must strengthen their sense of responsibility , mission , and urgency , consistently maintain high spirits , be bold and resolute in advancing , press forward despite the difficulties , and exert every endeavor to open up a new situation in work .
npc standing committee vice chairman cao zhi attended the guizhou discussion .
beijing , 7 mar (zxs) - - on 7 march vice premier qian qichen examined the government work report at the taiwan hall of the great hall of the people together with the taiwan delegates attending the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] .
he said it is our consistent position to oppose the indefinite delay of the taiwan issue .
he added that it is inadmissible for taiwan independence advocators , splittist forces , and foreign anti - chinese forces to hope to delay the taiwan issue indefinitely .
taiwan province delegates commented enthusiastically about the passage in the government work report on resolving the taiwan issue and on realizing the great cause of the motherland 's reunification .
they said they firmly supported the chinese government 's principled stand on one - china and all the chinese government 's measures to maintain the state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the delegates said that as taiwan compatriots , we feel the greater sense of urgency and sense of mission over the taiwan issue .
the " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems " are in accord with the greatest interests of all the chinese people , including those of the taiwan compatriots , and are the best ways to resolve the taiwan issue .
they expect the hope that their relatives on the island would make a cautious choice for the sake of taiwan , for their own security and their welfare .
qian qichen spoke after hearing the remarks of the delegates .
he said that following the reversion of hong kong and macao , the task of resolving the taiwan issue and of realizing the motherland 's complete reunification is thrust before all the chinese people .
in the " one - china principle and the taiwan issue " white paper published this year the chinese government reaffirmed its consistent position on resolving the taiwan issue , which elicited strong reactions at home and abroad .
he said the " one country , two systems , " which can be completely applicable to the taiwan issue , has been successfully implemented in hong kong and macao .
as the taiwan compatriots have the glorious tradition of patriotism , we sincerely place hope on the people of taiwan .
i believe that the taiwan people will surely make a correct choice over the issues that concern the state sovereignty and territory integrity , that concern the fundamental interests of the chinese nation , and that concern the destiny and fate of taiwan .
with the joint efforts of the people on both sides of the strait , the taiwan issue can surely be settled early .
qian qichen also took part in the deliberations of the work report by hong kong 's and macao 's delegations on the afternoon of 7 march .
during his attendance of the two delegations ' meetings , he reaffirmed the chinese government 's consistent position of resolving the taiwan issue according to the " one country , two systems " policy .
deputy fu quanyou said : the people 's liberation army of china [ pla ] is the great wall of steel defending the motherland and shouldering the sacred mission of protecting the security and territorial integrity of the country , and safeguarding the reunification of the motherland .
the early settlement of the taiwan issue and the reunification of the complete reunification of the motherland is a matter affecting china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , the invigoration and development of the chinese nation , and the national sentiments of all chinese people .
the taiwan issue is a historical issue left over by the chinese civil war , which is a completely internal affair of china . no external forces are entitled to intervene in it .
the chinese people 's eager desire for reunification and determination to oppose separation will not waver .
the act of some pro - taiwan independence elements and some foreign forces that do not want to see china 's reunification and try to separate taiwan from china is a gross intervention in china 's sovereignty and a serious provocation to the dignity of the chinese nation .
all pla officers and men have the determination , confidence , and capacity to resolutely stop all plots aimed at splitting the motherland and to successfully accomplish the sacred mission vested by the party and the people .
fu quanyou said : it is necessary to enhance political awareness , and firmly grasp the correct orientation of military work .
the party 's absolute leadership over the army should be always upheld so as to be politically firm and advanced and ideologically and morally pure .
yu yongbo stressed : leading cadres at all levels should act in accordance with chairman jiang zemin 's demand , regard successfully carrying out ideological and political work as the top priority duty and place the demand of stressing politics in all fields and missions concerning army building .
yu yongbo said : to strengthen ideological and political work under the situation of deepening reform , we must prominently grasp the key point of upholding and supporting reform and education .
we must see to it that the more we deepen reform the more the army should be educated so as to enhance the officers and men 's understanding of reform and unceasingly enhance their consciousness in upholding and supporting reform .
we should use the rich practice and tremendous achievements of reform to educate and guide officers and men to steel their conviction in building socialism with chinese characteristics and strengthen their trust in the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin at the core .
deputy wang ke said : strengthening national defense and army building is an important guarantee for safeguarding state security and unification .
after the return of hong kong and macao , the settlement of taiwan issue has become more prominent in front of us .
practice showed that the stronger the national defense strength of a country has and the more solid the preparations for military struggles are made , the less possibility for the separatists and hostile forces to act rashly and blindly .
to make good preparations for military struggles , we must carry out logistics work first .
the army logistical personnel should firmly keep in mind their missions , enhance their sense of urgency , and carry out their duties and responsibilities well .
we should concentrate financial resources to guarantee the building of equipment and further enhance the capacity to deal with emergency and to provide strategic and campaign logistics support .
it is necessary to vigorously promote reform of logistics work and persist in promoting its development through reform .
deputy wang ruilin said : cultivating high - quality military personnel is the fundamental plan for accelerating the building of a modern army .
the military personnel of a new type must have the quality and characteristics that meet the requirements of the times and global military development must have the distinct features of our army .
they must be politically strong , able to inherit and promote the fine traditions of our army , cherish the party and army , observe discipline , and have revolutionary ideals and integrity .
in addition , they must have strong political sharpness and discernment , maintain unity in terms of ideology and action with the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin at the core , and resolutely safeguard the party 's absolute leadership over the army .
they must have a good knowledge of science and culture , be good at many things and expert in one , and have an innovative spirit .
wang ruilin said : to cultivate and foster a great number of high - quality military personnel of a new type , we must also have a pioneering and enthusiastic mental state .
and leading comrades who went to join the discussion meetings of various delegations today are : tian jiyun , li changchun , wu guanzheng , jiang chunyun , jia qinglin , qian qichen , wen jiabao , wu yi , ismail amat , and wang zhongyu .
jiang chunyun pointed out that socialist market economy is an economy of legal system and that it is imperative to learn comprehensively applying legal , economic , administrative , and educational means and so on to strengthen the standardization and management of market economy .
especially , we should be good at applying legal means to ensure an orderly and healthy development of market economy , because legal means are of universal , specific , stable , and mandatory features .
it is necessary to proceed from the height of implementing the general plan of administrating the country according to laws and building a socialist country governed by laws to study this big subject and write this long article well .
qian qichen said that it should be selective in making developments and opening up and that ningxia can develop tourism of its own characteristics .
he said that tourism is a tertiary industry which involves little investment but attracts flows of tourists .
as long as there are sources of tourists , investment can be absorbed .
he said that although ningxia is situated inland and its natural conditions are not excellent , its ancient irrigation works , splendid xixia civilization , and unique customs and cultures are wholly capable of attracting tourists at home and abroad to bring along local economic developments .
therefore , it is imperative to develop tourism first and then develop suitable characteristic economy in the light of its own actual conditions .
while joining the discussion meeting of xinjiang delegation , wen jiabao said that it is necessary to fully understand the important significance of making great development in the western region .
while joining the discussion meeting of jiangxi delegation , wen jiabao said that in order to push forward the strategic readjustment of the economic structure of agriculture and rural areas , it is imperative to master four principles : 1 ) to regard market as a guide .
it is necessary to make readjustment in the light of market demands and changes to truly fulfill producing whatever market needs .
we should not make blind readjustments and cause new overstocking and sluggish sales .
3 ) to uphold adopting measures suiting local conditions .
4 ) it is necessary to fully respect the independent decision - making rights of peasants .
in readjusting structure , it is necessary to respect the wishes of peasants and realistically ensure peasants ' land contracting rights as well as decision - making rights in production and management .
the tasks for cadres at all levels are strengthening policy guidance and scientific and technological direction , adopting measures suiting local conditions , and adroitly guiding actions according to circumstances .
they should never issue arbitrary orders nor give blind directions .
regarding ways of " how to go out , " wu yi put forth four demands : 1 ) leading cadres at all levels should from now on put this work onto their agenda .
in conducting visits and inspections abroad and other foreign affairs activities , it is necessary to pay attention to promoting our own products and enterprises .
2 ) enterprises should have the guts and courage to " go out . "
it is necessary to have a correct analysis and understanding of the environments and conditions of foreign countries and learn how to correctly make good use of domestic and international markets .
after going out , it is necessary to attach importance to safeguarding our own image and reputation , because it has a bearing on the image and reputation of china .
3 ) it is necessary to have a whole set of coordinative laws and regulations .
efforts should be made to simplify some unnecessary procedures and provide policy support and guarantee for those outward going enterprises in the aspects of bank credits , foreign exchange management , policy insurance , export tax rebate , preferential provision of export operation rights , and so on .
and those outward going enterprises should also avoid malignant competition and killing each other , thus harming the interests of enterprises and the country .
wu yi emphasized that " introducing into " and " going out " are two mutually complementary aspects of our country 's reform and opening up .
wang zhongyu pointed out that party central committee and state council attach great importance to the work of xizang .
in recent years , xizang has made constant developments and great progress in economic construction and all social undertakings .
and the plan of making great development in western region can provide historical opportunities for xizang facing a new century .
how to keep up with the steps of making great development in the western region should be of far - reaching political and economic significance to xizang .
he said that xizang possesses abundant water and mineral resources as well as great development potentials .
( by reporter wang huaizhi [ 3769 3232 1807 ] )
during a recent period , with its stress laid on its highway construction , gansu has speeded up its comprehensive construction of railways , airports , water conservancy , energy , gas pipeline , telecommunications , radio , and urban infrastructure .
sun ying described the current construction speed with the term " seldom seen in history . "
this year , gansu 's anticipated investment target for highway construction stands at 5 billion yuan , a good 900 million yuan more than the province 's actually completed investment scale in 1999 .
in the past , gansu had not even one expressway in its strict sense ; yet last year , as many as two expressways started construction in the province .
by then , lanzhou , as the geographic center of china , will enjoy more convenient and fast links with its neighboring regions .
if we can successfully seize the historical opportunity of exchanging grain for forests and grass and take the initiative to readjust the structure , it is totally possible for us to build gansu into a production base of forestry and animal husbandry .
along with the growth of a market economy , the formulation of a buyer 's market , and the development of the trend of an economic globalization , this structural contradiction has been fully exposed .
sun ying believed : gansu ought to take resolute and decisive steps to readjust its economic structure during the large - scale development of the western region .
sun ying noted : gansu 's basic conditions have already undergone certain improvement , and what counts today is its soft environment , for there still exist many inadaptabilities in people 's ideological concepts , and in the province 's structure and mechanisms .
recently , the autonomous region has called a work conference on its implementation of the strategy on a large - scale development of the western region , and has conducted further studies and made work arrangements for its work concerning the development of the western region .
second , we have established a leading group for the autonomous region 's implementation of the strategy on a large - scale development of the western region , so as to strengthen the leadership , organization , and command over the region 's work of developing the western region .
third , we have actively drawn up plans and conducted demonstrations for the region 's western development work .
fourth , we have stepped up the selection and construction of the region 's projects concerning the development of the western region , and have accelerated the construction of ongoing projects so that they can produce a demonstration effect as soon as possible .
sixth , we have worked out supporting policies for attracting the participation of able personnel , funds , and technology from other parts of the country and the world in the development and construction of inner mongolia .
in view that different provinces and autonomous regions in the western areas have their own advantages , chongqing should set its eyes only on its own development with a narrow mind , or vie with others for a high status and more new construction projects .
meanwhile , chongqing should resolutely take part in and support any projects that can bring along the overall large - scale development of the western region , regardless of the benefits they are to bring to chongqing .
this shows that the opportunity of building yunnan into a " province strong in a green economy , " and the opportunity of building up a " china biological valley " in yunnan , has already arrived .

li ruihuan , member of the political bureau 's standing committee of the cpc central committee and chairman of the cppcc national committee , attended the meeting .
accelerating the implementation of the strategy of using science and education to prosper the country is a hot issue of discussion at the cppcc session .
on behalf of the committee on education , science , culture , public health and sports of the cppcc national committee , member xu guanhua said : we should fully understand the potential of china 's talents and the urgency of this issue .
in his speech , member you qingquan proposed to set up a science and technology development bank and accelerate reform and development of education in science and technology .
at present , the extra heavy burden of students of middle and primary schools has become a social problem much concerned by people in the society .
he also suggested a series of specific measures to adjust the structure of education , reform the evaluation and examination system , raise the standard of education and improve the overall quality of teachers .
in his speech , member le shouchang , who is vice chairman of the hunan provincial committee of the china democratic league , called for strengthening the basic policy of ruling the country according to the law and promoting the course of building a socialist country governed by law .

zhang wannian , vice chairman of the central military commission , in a group discussion also noted solemnly that our army would not tolerate and sit watching any attempts trying to split the motherland to prevail .
all these reflect the wish of the military and the people across the country .
deputy zhao guojun held : the east china sea fleet , located along the southeast coast , is at the forefront of the military struggle against taiwan .
all the armies , proceeding from the need of real wars , have unfolded activities of training the military with science and technology , and achieved some valuable results in the study of the method of operation .
our armament has been conspicuously improved ; new armament has become combat - ready ; and the fleet 's capability of comprehensive operation has also been greatly boosted .
" the people in mainland and in taiwan all wish for reunification . "
the us air force says no one is able to detect its f-117 fighters .
the us navy says its vessel - carried " aegis " air - defense system can detect any target in the air .
one may ask : can they have a trial of strength ?
on that evening , the f-117 fighters attacked about 35 percent of the strategic targets .
they flew into the most risky zones and were exposed to risks over considerable time .
because of their characteristic of being invisible , f-117 fighters do not need all kinds of support and protection in the air as other visible airplanes do .
they can attack various kinds of targets , and some targets can only be hit by f-117 fighters .
during the war , f-117 fighters flew 1,296 sorties , which accounted for 2 percent of the total sorties of the multinational troops , but 40 percent of the strategic targets in iraq were hit by f-117 fighters .
all of a sudden , f-117 fighters increased its status and one fabulous story after another was told about them .
nevertheless , facts were different from what the us air force said : no one is able to detect its f-117 fighters .
from their appearance during the us troops ' attack on panama in 1989 to being shot down in yugoslavia on 27 march 1999 , self - destruction of the f-117 fighters occurred on many occasions .
in 1995 and 1997 , two f-117 crashed in the process of training and another crashed at an aviation exposition .
within one week after the first f-117 fighter was downed , another was damaged and compelled to land in macedonia .
what is interesting is the us defense department 's attitude toward the fact that the federal republic of yugoslavia was able to down a f-117 fighter .
it was only several days later that the us defense department was compelled to admit that one f-117 fighter had been downed .
in this way , the flaw of what is sold by the spear and shield seller was exposed .
a similar flaw was also seen in the " apache " attack helicopters dispatched by the us armed forces to the balkans .
such " wonderful " airplanes were unable to " display " their skills in the gulf war . besides , two of them crashed in the balkan region .
in the gulf war , another arms system that was always in the limelight was the " patriot " defense missile .
in a report on the gulf war , the us defense department pointed out : the " patriot " missiles were first used to shoot at airplanes . later the ground force modified it into an anti - strategic missile system .
during the war , the us armed forces deployed 29 " patriot " missile companies in the gulf region .
according to the assessment of the us armed forces , the " patriot " missile companies provided valuable defense for the ports and airports of saudi arabia .
the defense department said the " patriot " missiles attained political success by excluding israel from the war and strengthening the confidence of the multinational troops .
such confidence was attributed to the " patriot " missiles as well as to a large number of news propagandists employed by the us armed forces .
by means of the media , the " patriot " missiles became famous air defense missiles in the world .
in the beginning , a report by the us armed forces said the " patriot " missiles successfully intercepted over 90 percent of iraq 's " scud " missiles .
in the middle stage of the war , the us armed forces reduced the rate to successful interception to over 60 percent .
after the war was over , it was reported that in the gulf war , the united states launched a total of 158 " patriot " missiles , four missiles were directly intercepted , and the rate of success was only 8.5 percent .
were the statistical figures of the us military incorrect ?
the answer was negative .
on the one hand , as the us armed forces themselves put it , the " patriot " missiles strengthened the confidence of the multinational troops and the israeli military and civilians , and that was a political " victory " of the multinational troops .
the us - led multinational troops evidently made use of some weapons and equipment they had for psychological warfare to scare the iraqi military and people and to boost their own morale .
on the other hand , it goes without saying that war is always welcomed by arms dealers , and exaggerating the weapons and equipment produced by them as overrunning all fortifications and being perfect has exactly revealed the mental state of contemporary us spear and shield sellers .
since he assumed office two years ago , han zhubin , the seventh supreme chief procurator of the republic and chief procurator of the supreme people 's procuratorate , has faithfully performed his duty .
exposures and investigations of these major cases fully demonstrated the party and state 's firm resolve to fight corruption and the authority and justice of the socialist rule by law .
we have noticed that procuratorial organs last year deliberately stepped up lawsuit supervision and seriously investigated committing crimes by judicial personnel , which was the cause of judicial injustice . [ han ] you are right .
last year , procuratorial organs widely stepped up supervision over putting cases on file for investigations , trial of civil and administrative cases , execution of criminal punishment , and other legal actions .
what results have been achieved in carrying out these six reform measures over the last year ? [ han ] reform of procuratorial work has brought us not only innovations in the systems and mechanisms , but also progress in our understanding and perception of law enforcement .
a total of 168 prefectural and city procuratorates and 1,159 grass - roots procuratorates throughout the country have instituted the prosecuting procurator case handling responsibility system . by means of competition , we selected 3,689 prosecuting procurators .
procuratorial organs at all levels have continued to reform the cadres management system - - so far 2,332 procuratorates have implemented a system to promote intermediate - level leaders through competition and 2,086 procuratorates have the choice to pick their cadres , and vice versa .
to provide intellectual support for the development of procuratorial work , the supreme people 's procuratorate and 25 provincial - level procuratorates have formed specialist counseling committees and 96 prefectural - level procuratorates have formed specialist counseling committees or groups .
the work system of procuratorial committees has been further refined and their role in making work decision and providing macro - guidance has been strengthened .
in the central authorities ' structural reform spirit , the supreme people 's procuratorate adjusted its internal organs and currently is conducting investigations and studies on carrying out structural reform within the procuratorial establishment . [ reporter ] to supervise others , one first has to supervise himself .
how can procuratorates , as statutory legal supervision organs , discipline themselves before they perform their work ? [ han ] of the more than 3,000 procuratorates throughout the country , more than 80 percent are grass - roots procuratorates .
all grass - roots procuratorates have regarded the masses ' satisfaction as the top objective and taken corrective actions starting from where the people are not satisfied , establishing a good image of just law enforcement by the people 's procuratorates .
last year , one third of the country 's grass - roots procuratorates met the " five goods " requirements .
i have held more than 10 meetings with npc deputies and cppcc national committee members to directly hear their suggestions and opinion .
last year , the supreme people 's procuratorate visited 234 npc deputies and cppcc national committee members , handled 46 suggestions and motions presented by them , and handled 162 cases relayed by them .
the us state department recently trotted out a so - called appraisal report to make improper comments on the anti - drug efforts of some 20 countries .
towards the " unacceptable countries , " it threatened to impose sanctions on them ; and towards the barely " acceptable " countries , it found faults in a petty manner .
mexico was included in this appraisal report . so the personages on all circles of mexico expressed strong dissatisfaction with such a domineering act of the united states .
following are the major reasons for mexico 's opposition to this appraisal report : the appraisal conducted by the united states constitutes the interference in other countries ' internal affairs as well as the infringement of other countries ' sovereignty .
the united states ' playing as a " super judge " to make irresponsible comments and indiscreet criticisms on other countries ' anti - drug campaign is caused by the deep - rooted bad habit of seeking hegemony .
this is the result of the enormous efforts of the mexican government . however , the us appraisal report has always underestimated and even defied such efforts and achievements of other countries .
like the big stick of " human rights , " the anti - drug appraisal report is also a big stick in the hands of the united states .
should someone do not obey its direction , it will use this big stick to threaten it or easily impose sanctions on it .
its purpose is to impose its will on other countries and force others to completely obey its directions .
the united states is fault - finding with other countries ' anti - drug campaign but carefully avoids mentioning the serious drug abuse problem existing in its own country .
in fact , the united states is the number one narcotics consuming state in the world , and it is precisely the united states that most needs to review the drug abuse problem .
drug abuse has spread unchecked so seriously in the united states , thus we can see that the unites states has been failed in wiping out drug abuse .
why doesn 't the us government appraise its own anti - drug effort ?
failing in its own affair , what right has the united states to find fault with other countries ?
the crackdown on drug abuse needs international cooperation . however , this should be based on the respect to national sovereignty and peace .
just as warned by mexican attorney general madrazo , all the acts of infringing upon other country 's sovereignty mean the indulgence with narcotic - related crimes .
now the number of our party members has hit 61 million .
it is not easy to manage well such a large group .
if we neglect and slacken management of them , there will be problems , even serious problems .
when we conduct construction of the party , we must focus on managing grass - roots party organizations and on educating each party member cadre in his thought , working style and organizational discipline .
plus , we must focus on these unyieldingly . our party is , in general , in an important period of replacing old cadres with young ones .
an urgent and important political task we face is to cultivate and build up a large batch of young cadres with good ideological and political qualities , a high level of cultural knowledge and strong leadership abilities .
young cadres cannot grow up healthily unless they toughen themselves and undergo trials in reform , opening up and the construction of modernization .
the trend of diversification in social components , economic components , organizational forms , material interests and hiring methods will further develop in the future .
these need further study and we must formulate a set of feasible policies and measures as soon as possible .
in some serious criminal cases which involved some leading cadres and were exposed in the past several years and recently , the seriousness of the crimes and the large quantity of money involved are astounding .
these leading cadres were shot by sugarcoated bullets of money and sex and made tradeoffs between money and their power and between sex and their power . they went so far as to being blinded by lust for gain , being audacious in the extreme and becoming absolutely lawless .
when analyzing these cases from the aspect of system , the largest problem is that we have not formed the most effective supervisory and management system .
we must strive to solve this problem with our systems .
our great causes place limitless hopes on the great party , and the great party is leading our great causes .
comrades of the entire party must , under the leadership of the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core , strive to build our party and make it more vigorous , united and rich in fighting power .
this is a new development in our party 's guiding thought on strengthening the construction of the socialist spiritual civilization .
advanced cultures are the crystallization of the development of human civilization . they also provide spiritual motivation and intellectual support which promote the development of human society . they influence people 's spirit and souls and permeate all quarters of society .
advanced political parties represent not only the necessities of the development of advanced productive forces but also the development direction of advanced cultures .
only in this way can advanced political parties let material civilization and spiritual civilization develop in coordination and can they promote the comprehensive progress of society .
the quality , ability , and rise and decline of a political party , a country , or a nation is determined by whether or not they have advanced cultures and represent the development direction of advanced cultures .
advanced cultures are healthy , scientific , progressive , represent the development direction of the future , and promote social development . they are not decadent , passive , ignorant , or backward , nor do they hinder social development .
advanced cultures include two components : ideological morality and scientific culture .
the reasons for communists being advanced include that communists have not only advanced ideological morality but also advanced scientific and cultural knowledge . the two parts complement each other and cannot be separated .
the culture of ideological morality decides the social nature of the whole culture , leads the development of the whole culture and promotes the progress of society , economy , and politics .
if correct thoughts do not occupy the ideological front , wrong thoughts will occupy it . if the marxist and proletarian spirit does not occupy the ideological front , various non - marxist and non - proletarian thoughts , even anti - marxist thoughts , will occupy it .
in the construction of ideology and culture , we must persist in treating marxism as our guide .
to represent the development direction of advanced cultures , we must strive to advocate studying scientific and cultural knowledge and developing the scientific and cultural cause .
scientific and cultural knowledge is the basis of social civilization and the bridge for mankind 's progress .
without the accumulation of scientific and cultural knowledge , we cannot climb the high hills of science or that of ideological morality .
in the current world , science develops rapidly and changes in each passing day .
we must establish a scientific spirit , master scientific methods , study scientific knowledge , eliminate ignorance , oppose feudalism and superstition , and comprehensively improve our quality of science and culture .
this move for purging the party of corruption and eliminating harm to the people is resolutely supported by the whole party and people .
the hu changqing case is an extremely serious case of economic crime which created an extremely bad impact in society because he was a senior cadre .
a criminal who has committed such very serious crime must be put to death in order to set straight state law and calm the people 's anger and in order to set straight party work style and oppose corruption ; no less penalty will suffice .
the investigation and handling of the hu changqing case shows that the cpc central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core is unswerving in being strict with party members , ruling the country according to law , and severely punishing corruption .
hu changqing is the most senior leading cadre to be sentenced to death for economic crime since the founding of the new china .
in fact that is precisely what he did , and that is precisely how he turned into an out - and - out corrupt official .
it is evident from this that as soon as power is in the hands of corrupt elements , it will become " capital " for bringing calamity on the state and the people .
the facts of hu changqing 's crimes tell us that in conditions of reform , opening up , and socialist market economy , the fundamental issue regarding how to avoid succumbing to various lures is to strengthen political convictions and build a party that serves the people 's interests .
the higher their post and the greater their power , the more must they strictly discipline themselves .
in addition to setting strict demands on themselves , they must also strictly educate and manage their spouses , children , and colleagues .
judging by the major and important cases involving leading cadres in recent years , an important reason why certain leading cadres succeed in trading power for money is that the cadre supervisory and management mechanism is not yet on a sound enough basis .
in this respect , we must resolutely enforce the existing systems , continue to perfect those that need perfecting , and get a good grasp of setting up those that have not yet been set up .
the severe punishment of hu changqing according to law is an alert for the leading cadres , a warning for those who refuse to come to their senses , and an encouragement and stimulus for the masses .
li ruihuan , member of the standing committee of the political bureau of the cpc central committee and chairman of the cppcc national committee , attended the meeting .
yang rudai , ren jianxin , chen junsheng , zhang siqing , mao zhiyong , luo haocai , and zhou tienong served as executive chairmen at today 's meeting , which was presided over by zhang siqing .

the implementation of the strategy of developing china 's western region has brought an unprecedented development opportunity to the country 's western region . how should the western region catch the time and seize the right moment to boost its development ?
some npc delegates and cppcc members have come out with good ideas and suggestions .
meanwhile , a number of newly adopted measures , such as the natural forests protection project and the practice of returning grain plots to forestry ( grass - raising ) , have also won popular support .
meanwhile , we should integrate ecological projects with a rational operation of peasants , instead of simply ordering peasants to return their grain plots and stop felling trees .
government departments should think of more ways to create jobs for peasants , increase their income , and turn the protective operation of forests and meadows into a means for arousing the enthusiasm of peasants in the practice of returning their grain plots .
member liu yonghao : protection of the ecological environment is closely linked to the development of the economy .
relying on new and high technologies to make breakthroughs [ subhead ] delegate zhou houjian : innovation is the soul of progress for a nation , and should all the more be the soul of our large - scale development of china 's western region .
in recent years , there has been a feverish price war in china 's industry of home electrical appliances , causing a malignant competition in the industry .
in comparison with the manufacturing industry , developing the software industry is a more ready approach for attracting major foreign corporations into china 's central and western regions .
as regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between china 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in china 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .
delegate sun guoqiang : the development of new and advanced technologies should be fully integrated with both the realistic conditions and the market demands of the western region .
strengthening agriculture and laying a solid foundation for the large - scale development [ subhead ] delegate he guoqiang : in our development of the country 's western region , we should by no means overlook the role played by agriculture as a foundation .
of course , the agricultural structure of china 's he western region needs to undergo further readjustments , and also needs to shift its focus from a quantity - oriented growth to a quality - oriented growth .
member chen zongxing : the large - scale development of china 's western region has many major focuses , yet strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation is particularly important .
evaluating our advantage in resources from the angle of the world development trend delegate shi jun : people often say that the western region has a vast territory , abundant resources , and huge development potentialities .
such a remark cannot be said untrue , but is incomprehensive and unscientific .
advantage in resources can only be seen through the market ; therefore , if the market does not need your advantage , you cannot say that you enjoy an advantage .
member lai gaohuai : it is a misunderstanding to think that resources are the focus of our development of the country 's western region .
abundant resources are just a material foundation for our large - scale development of the western region , and one should not look to resources as the only object of the development .
only when we introduce a protective scientific development , pay attention to the market value of resources , and turn our resource advantage into a market advantage can we attain a sustainable development .
member han yingxuan : we qinghai province enjoys four major resource advantages , namely salt lakes , gas , hydropower , and non - ferrous metals .
the meeting was held in a lively atmosphere , and the delegates took the floor one after another .
this year , we aim to lower the number of loss - making large and medium state - owned and state - holding enterprises from 35 percent to a level below 30 percent .
we will make continued efforts to readjust the industrial structure of old industrial bases in liaoning through such means as bankruptcy , merger , and technical transformation .
meanwhile , we will also intensify the work of social security and re - employment , and step up the re - employment of laid - off workers from state enterprises .
according to a briefing given by delegate liu jie from the angang group corporation , through transforming its operating mechanisms , strengthening its management , and conducing a technical transformation , the angang group corporation has made some improvement in its operation .
he expressed hope that relevant departments can join hands with enterprises , speed up the practice of turning debts into equity , and pay close attention to the establishment and improvement of a social security system .
delegate lin zuoming believed that the work of establishing a modern enterprise system and reinforcing management is key to extricating large and medium state enterprises from their present difficulties .
meanwhile , more preferential policies should also be worked out in order to attract outstanding students studying overseas to return home .
delegates gao yirong , zuo changlin , and wang dacao gave their respective views on such issues as extricating enterprises from their present difficulties , establishing a social security system , and maintaining the stability of the society .
after hearing the views of the delegates , zhu rongji also gave a speech to the meeting .
although we are still faced with a lot of difficulties , we are also enjoying many favorable conditions .
particularly , we should strengthen the ideological and political work among these workers , so as to ensure a sound stability in society .
the task of establishing and perfecting a social security system is an urgent need for deepening the reform of state enterprises , and also a measure of fundamental significance for maintaining the stability of our society .
therefore , we should place the task on an important position and see to its sound implementation , zhu rongji stressed .
beijing , 8 mar ( xinhua ) - - this morning , president jiang zemin showed up in the hong kong room of the great hall of the people to join the hong kong delegation of deputies in their deliberations .
fifty to sixty chinese and foreign correspondents covering the third plenary session of the ninth national people 's congress surged forward and swarmed around him .
" president jiang : if the two sides of the taiwan strait go to war , is it not internecine strife ? " a reporter asked loudly as soon as president jiang zemin had taken his seat .
" this phrase of yours is taken from the verse of cao zhi [ a poet in the wei dynasty ] , " jiang zemin said .
he then recited : " they were boiling beans over a fire made of beanstalks .
came a plaintive voice from the pot , ' o , why , since we sprang from the selfsame root , should you kill me with burning anger ? ' "
" if 'internecine strife ' arises because some people promote ' taiwan independence , ' then it is of their own making .
' we sprang from the selfsame root ' - - from one china . why should one promote taiwan independence ? "
jiang zemin 's reply won warm applause from the hong kong deputies and chinese and foreign correspondents present on the scene .
then , another reporter asked : are you afraid of interference by foreign forces on the taiwan issue ?
waving his hand , jiang zemin said : " the chinese people are never scared of evil forces ! "
another round of warm applause reverberated around the hong kong room .
then came a question from yet another reporter : are you willing to go to taiwan , president jiang ?
jiang zemin spread out his hands and said : " do you have to ask ?
of course , i am willing to go .
but how can i go when someone is promoting a 'two - state theory ' ? "
today 's plenary session of the hong kong delegation was not open to the public .
glancing around at the dozen or so cameras and television cameras and the crush of reporters in the hong kong room , jiang zemin said with a smile : " we are having a virtual news conference today . "
jiang zemin , li peng , zhu rongji , li lanqing , and other central leading comrades separately joined delegations from macao , hong kong , xinjiang , liaoning , qinghai , and chongqing in the discussion .
responsible officials of relevant state council departments also went to various delegations to hear their views .
the third session of the ninth chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] national committee held a third plenary meeting this morning . ten members took the floor to speak . the session held group discussion on the government work report and other reports in the afternoon .
the chinese government promises that after entering the wto , it will lower its tariffs on some agricultural products and guide and encourage foreign investment in agriculture .
china 's agriculture has achieved tremendous progress through more than 20 years of reform and opening up . it spite of its limited arable land , the problem of feeding 1.2 billion people has been resolved .
he maintained that poor information and the lack of contacts with the outside world were factors hampering the further development of agriculture in the region .
wto access and the further opening of the country will no doubt hasten the solution of this problem .
deputy mao daru anticipated that the merger of the chinese and international markets following china 's wto entry would accelerate the process of the marketization of agriculture and increase the export of vegetables , fruit , animal products and aquatic products for which china has a leading edge .
the import of foreign agricultural products would hasten the elimination of varieties which no longer meet market needs , such as wheat , early rice , corn and tangerines , as well as the introduction of premium varieties needed by the market .
positive guidance by the government and more foreign investment in the agricultural sector will play an important part in this process .
vice minister of agriculture wan baorui said after the signing of the sino - u.s. agreement on the wto last year that following its wto access , china would further improve its policies and laws to attract more foreign funds , technologies and managerial experience into the agricultural sector .
china would also increase its input in agricultural infrastructure construction , make more intense efforts to engage in agricultural scientific research and promote practical technologies , and actively develop and import new varieties and technologies .
in fact , both public and private sectors have started their preparations for entry into the wto .
the chinese government recently announced that some grain varieties of poorer quality would no longer be eligible for protective pricing in state grain purchases .
as analyzed by some experts , this policy essentially means that the government will be using its pricing policy to guide peasants in adjusting their crop mix as an important step in preparation of wto access .
mao daru said : as china slowly merges with the international market , the explorations being made today are valuable and meaningful first steps whether or not they turn out to be successful .
li peng , member of the political bureau standing committee of the cpc central committee and chairman of the npc standing committee , came to the xinjiang hall in the great of the people this morning to join the xinjiang delegation in its discussion of the government work report .
he stressed : the people of all nationalities in xinjiang should strengthen national unity , seize the present new opportunity , and boost the economic development of the region .
taking the floor one after another , delegates of different nationalities from xinjiang conducted a thoroughgoing deliberation of the government work report .
li peng listened to the opinions of delegates carefully , and took notes from time to time .
when the delegates were making speeches at the meeting , he often chipped in and made detailed inquiries of the concrete situation , and also joined the delegates in their discussion of different issues .
delegate liu zhouren was first to speak .
he said : if xinjiang wants to attain great development , it has to vigorously develop its scientific and technological , as well as educational , undertakings .
to do this , we should mobilize all means to bring up and attract able personnel , and create a sound environment for the able personnel to show their ability and talent .
delegate abdulahat abdurixit gave a speech on xinjiang 's present construction situation .
he noted : we should treasure the present situation of stability and unity in xinjiang , and promote the unity and harmony among all nationalities ; and only in this way can we ensure a smooth implementation of the strategy of large - scale western development .
meanwhile , we should reinforce the building of infrastructure ; make readjustments to xinjiang 's economic structure , especially its agricultural structure ; explore and develop resources ; and improve the living standards of our people .
delegate amudong niyazi indicated in his speech that a sound policy environment is key to the success of a large - scale development of the western region .
delegate mamatmin yasheng gave his views on the issue of making readjustments to xinjiang 's agricultural structure ; while delegate guo minjie spoke on such issues as developing xinjiang 's railway transport facilities and promoting the state enterprise reform .
delegate wang lequan spoke of ways to accelerate xinjiang 's economic development and to adapt it to the demands of the large - scale development of the western region .
after hearing the views of the delegates , li peng also delivered a speech at the meeting .
li peng pointed out : the large - scale development of the western region has provided a new opportunity for xinjiang 's future development .
it can be said that xinjiang currently enjoys " favorable climatic , geographical , and human conditions . "
national unity is the core of " favorable human conditions " in xinjiang .
with these three favorable conditions , xinjiang can surely cut a striking figure in the large - scale development of the country 's western region .
xinjiang should continue to pay close attention to reinforcing its basic industries and infrastructure construction , stressed li peng .
xinjiang should promote its pillar industries , such as oil , gas , high - quality cotton , and animal husbandry ; and improve the living standards of its people .
only when xinjiang has a well - developed economy can it successfully consolidate national unity .
separatism hinders the development of the economy ; therefore , the people of all nationalities in xinjiang should place unity above everything else .
this is also a major condition for improving the investment environment .
xinjiang is richly endowed by nature ; and under the vigorous support of the central government and by relying on the concerted efforts of people of all nationalities , xinjiang can surely march at the head in the large - scale development of the western region .
abdulahat abdurixit , chairman of the xinjiang uygur autonomous regional people 's government , also pointed out that the region plans to solve the problem of food and clothing for 300,000 people before the end of this year .
tong fu , member of the npc standing committee and vice chairman of the npc 's foreign affairs committee , said that this would be china 's important progress in human rights .
he emphatically pointed out that , in a developing country like china , we must first solve problems of the right of survival and the right of development .
if these problems are not solved , we are not qualified to talk about protecting human rights in other fields .
he held that tibet with such poor natural conditions was transformed directly from a backward serfdom to a socialist society . tibet 's achievements are due to the unremitting and great efforts of the chinese government over the past years .
although the overall level of development is still not high , , the central government has always tried hard to support development in tibet .
legqog said : at present , there is no railway in tibet . the poor communications are limiting economic development .
tibet plans to make an unprecedented investment of six billion yuan to improve transportation , electric power and communications and speed up the pace of enriching the peasants and herdsmen and developing the economy .
in the neighboring xinjiang uygur autonomous region , 300,000 poor people are mostly living in areas with very poor natural conditions .
toward those peasants with very low income , agricultural tax will be waived .
china started to implement the national plan to assist poor people in 1993 with a goal to solve the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in rural areas within seven years .
beijing , 8 mar - - state president jiang zemin this morning took part in a discussion meeting of the hong kong delegation to the third session of the ninth national people 's congress .
the deputies were enthusiastic in their speeches during the discussion .
jiang zemin spoke after earnestly listening to the speeches of the hong kong deputies .
he said : the general situation in the hong kong sar has been good in the more than two years since its establishment .
the success we have achieved in comprehensively implementing the guidelines of " one country , two systems , " " hong kong people governing hong kong , " and a high degree of autonomy is acknowledged by the whole world .
this achievement was not easily gained .
during this period hong kong has undergone a number of storms and encountered many difficulties .
with the support of the central government , the sar government headed by mr. tung chee - hwa has led the compatriots of hong kong to work with concerted efforts to get through the hard times , and its work has been highly successful .
jiang zemin emphasized that it is necessary to grasp " one country , two systems " as a complete concept .
in upholding the one country principle , it is essential to guarantee unity of sovereignty , and separation is not permitted .
the high degree of autonomy of the sars is granted by the central government through the basic law , and they must consciously preserve national sovereignty , unity , and territorial integrity , and uphold the national state and political systems set down by the constitution .
the central government does not interfere in affairs within the scope of the sars ' high degree of autonomy , and the sars cannot interfere in the socialist political system in the interior of the motherland .
jiang zemin pointed out that it is now 10 years since the hong kong basic law was promulgated .
the facts have proven that the basic law is full of vitality .
governing hong kong according to law is an important component of our practice of governing the country according to law .
upholding the authority of the basic law means upholding the authority of the state legal system .
it is necessary to resolutely and consistently implement the things set down in the basic law ; this is the fundamental guarantee for maintaining hong kong 's long - term stability and prosperity .
i have said many times that the hong kong basic law is a nationwide law which must be observed by the whole country , not just hong kong .
everyone must support the work of the sar chief executive .
the central government , the sar government departments , and all sectors of society in hong kong must support it .
people in all walks of life in hong kong should strengthen unity on the basis of upholding the fundamental interests of the state and hong kong .
so long as everyone works in concert , hong kong 's affairs will certainly be run well .
jiang zemin pointed out that mankind is advancing , and china is advancing .
the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation is sure to be attained during the 21st century .
we must have confidence in this .
with this confidence , we will be able to consistently overcome all hardships and difficulties with brimming enthusiasm and the spirit of endeavor , and unswervingly advance toward our brilliant set goal .
state council vice premier qian qichen and state council hong kong and macao affairs office director liao hui attended the meeting of the hong kong delegation today .
state president jiang zemin this morning [ 8 march ] attended a discussion meeting of the macao delegation attending the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] .
compatriots and people of various circles in macao should work with concerted efforts to turn the wish of people of the entire country for " a more magnificent macao tomorrow " into a reality .
at the meeting , deputies expressed their opinions one after another on the report on the work of the government .

deputy wu shiming , who is chairman of the macao neighborhood affiliation , offered his suggestions on giving full play to the intermediary role of macao in developing cross - strait relations .
deputy yang yunzhong , who is a professor of the macao university , spoke on matters of implementing " one country , two systems " and ushering in a more magnificent future .
deputy liu yiliang , who is chairman of the board of the macao chuangshi enterprise group , suggested to establish a " coordination committee for cooperation between guangdong , hong kong and macao " in order to promote cooperation in developing regional economy in the zhujiang delta .
after seriously listening to speeches made by deputies , jiang zemin also made a speech .
i wish to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you .
the overall situation in the past three months since macao 's return to the motherland has been good .
the work of the msar government has achieved an initial success .
jiang zemin emphatically said : the successful return of macao is the inevitable result of the motherland 's becoming strong and prosperous .
after the opium war , the chinese nation had gone through all kinds of hardships and repeatedly suffered from aggressions and humiliations by the big powers .
hong kong and macao also had gone through all the vicissitudes of life and were ruled by foreigners for a long period .
the communist party of china [ cpc ] led people of various nationalities in the whole country to wage protracted and arduous struggles and achieved national independence and people 's liberation in the mid 20th century and established the new china .
hong kong and macao all returned to the embrace of the motherland under this background .
in the wake of the development of building socialism with chinese characteristics , our country will certainly become more prosperous and strong .
the future of hong kong and macao will certainly be more wonderful .
jiang zemin pointed out : in observing and evaluating the situation in macao , we think it is necessary to take hold of four basic things or , in other words , four " firm beliefs . "
we can say with full confidence that macao 's future will be more stable and prosperous .
jiang zemin pointed out : the main policy to implement " one country , two systems " will be the same in hong kong and macao .
therefore , we must firmly proceed from the actual conditions in macao and fully implement the policies of " one country , two systems " and " macao people administering macao " with a high degree of self - autonomy , and constantly sum up experiences in practice .
touching on the issue of public security in macao , jiang zemin said : the central government has always shown concern for the issue of social security in macao .
after the return of macao , public security has been improved significantly under the effective management of the msar government .
this has fully explained that the msar government is fully capable of improving public security .
the central government will give full support to the msar government 's efforts to improve public security .
the issue of macao 's public security is related to the vital interests of the broad masses of residents in macao , macao 's tourism and economic development in all fields , and macao 's international image .
we must properly solve this problem and truly turn macao into a peaceful and auspicious society .
in conclusion , jiang zemin hoped representatives from macao would seriously fulfill their duties as npc deputies , actively take part in and make suggestions on state affairs , and contribute ideas and exert efforts for the construction and development of the motherland .
vice premier of the state council qian qichen and head of the state council 's office for hong kong and macao affairs liao hui attended the macao delegation 's meeting today .
tang xinqiao , head of the macao delegation , presided over today 's discussion meeting .
this morning , zhou yongkan said this when openly being interviewed by chinese and foreign reporters .
a reporter asked what is the main objectives and measures sichuan will pursue in the great development of china 's west .
zhou yongkang said : sichuan 's population and gdp account for nearly one - third of the total of the 10 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality in china 's west .
in recent years , sichuan province actively adopted measures for arousing the initiative of existing human resources , and strove to turn the scientific and technological advantages into economic advantages .
he stressed the key to the great development of china 's west lies in human resources . sichuan will spare no effort to improve and create conditions for attracting more intelligent human resources to participate in the great development of china 's west .
to answer a reporter 's question about how to attract domestic and foreign investors to launch new enterprises in china 's west , zhang zhongwei said : the great development of china 's west is actually a great opening - up of china 's west .
over more than 10 years in the past , sichuan absorbed and used $ 13.2 billion of foreign funds , and $ 6.7 billion was actually spent . more then 50 transnational companies have made investment or set up offices in sichuan .
zhou yongkang also answered other questions raised by chinese and foreign reporters .
china decontrolled the renminbi current accounts in 1994 , but it still exercises a strict control over the renminbi capital accounts . according to the government , there is still no definitive timetable for renminbi convertibility .
when china avoided the heavy impact from the asian financial crisis , the renminbi non - convertibility was regarded as an important " firewall . "
for this reason , china has become even more cautious with respect to decontrolling renminbi capital accounts .
however , during the market management , whenever a large number of illegal purchase of foreign exchanges or illegal remittance of foreign exchanges are likely , the authorities will tighten the management , creating tedious formalities and causing conveniences .
this is mainly because the renminbi capital accounts have not yet been decontrolled . to differentiate the two different types of accounts , many additional stipulations are set to ensure that the foreign exchanges from the renminbi capital accounts remain under a strict control .
he believes that accession to the wto will be a rare great opportunity to china and the connection between china and international market will be even more closer .
we should relax restrictions on the proportion of foreign companies ' technology transfer and domestic sales and on the proportion of their investment in certain sectors , and encourage foreign companies to invest in agriculture , infrastructure , the environmental protection industry , and hi - tech industries .
we should actively attract multinational companies to invest in china , and in particular encourage them to invest in research and development and to take part in the reorganization and revamping of state enterprises .
as everyone knows , for china to open up to the world in the fields of commerce , foreign trade , finance , insurance , securities , telecommunications , tourism , and intermediary services is a matter of great caution .
during the sino - us negotiations on wto entry , there was protracted argument over the process of opening up these sectors .
there has been similar controversy in china 's wto negotiations with the european union .
china has a great deal of work to do to adapt to the new situation of wto entry .
he pointed out that this year china will further improve its investment environment and expand the methods and sectors for using foreign investment .
it will relax restrictions on the sectors and areas where foreign companies can invest and on technology transfer , technology content , foreign exchange balance , and foreign investment proportions .
china will actively promote opening up in a measured way in finance , insurance , telecommunications , tourism , and service trades .
according to the latest chinese official statistics , last year china actually used $ 56.3 billion in foreign investment ( including loans and direct investment ) , a drop of 3.9 percent compared with 1998 .
they hold that china 's existing rules and regulations do not benefit the development of our telecommunications and should be amended and readjusted .
this will help in the intense international competition after china joins the wto .
central connecticut state university started to establish exchange and cooperation with a number of schools of higher learning in china since 1972 . in 1996 , the university set up a china resources management center to help china train specialists in economic , financial , education and other fields .
the provinces will make careful arrangements so that their speakers can directly reflect their problems and make suggestions to the central authorities in order to get help .
since vice premier wen jiabao is in charge of agriculture , banking , science and technology , water conservancy , and poverty relief in the state council , the speeches by the shaanxi deputies today also centered on these topics .
when xian mayor feng xuchu [ 7458 3563 0443 ] suggested building a hi - tech securities exchange in xian , wen jiabao interrupted his speech by saying : " i would also like to make a suggestion . "
wen jiabao said : i do not know whether you have noticed this trend : with the development of the internet , the number of stock exchanges in the world has decreased rather than increased .
the average cost of over - the - counter transaction is $ 1.07 , that of telephone transaction is $ 0.52 , and that of electronic teller machines is $ 0.27 , but it only costs $ 0.01 per transaction on the internet .
i suggest that xian should study and work out its strategy for the development of information industry . the earlier it starts , the earlier it can reap the benefits .
shaanxi should make use of its own leading edge in science and technology . you have the conditions .
listening , jotting down notes , and raising questions are wen jiabao 's " trilogy " at these meetings .
he has been to shaanxi many times and knows the region very well .
i said to him : this is what the government should be doing .
he said : i have let the government down .
i said : it is the government that has let you down .
the second was that the place was planning the building of its power grid and each peasant had to contribute several thousand yuan . shangluo even got its share of beijing 's apportioned charges .
the third was that the village party branch secretaries who accompanied me on the inspection were wearing patched garments .
these three things which the vice premier spoke of also moved the deputies who attended the discussion .
the development of the western region was the hottest topic under discussion by members of the two npc delegations .
li lanqing stressed : the development of science and technology should start off first in the development of the western region , and it is necessary to adopt a special policy to develop education there .
at the meeting of the qinghai delegation , deputies bai enpei , ma peihua , jiang yu , and bao yizhi , as well as governor zhao leji of qinghia province who attended the meeting as an observer , spoke successively .
they held : the report on the work of the government used more words to explain the strategy for the large - scale development of the western region , inspiring the people of various nationalities in qinghai province .

at the two meetings , deputies tried to get the floor before others , and the atmosphere was very lively .
while earnestly took notes , li lanqing interposed a remark or two from time to time to discuss questions with deputies .
li lanqing expressed his views at the two meetings .
he said : the policy decision of the party central committee and the state council on the strategy for the development of the western region has received support from the whole nation .
the development of science and technology should start off first in the development of the western region , and multiple measures should be taken to train , retain , and attract qualified personnel from home and abroad and to bring their role into full play .
in education , special efforts should be made to do a good job in elementary education and in fulfilling the targets of making nine - year compulsory education universal and wiping out illiteracy among the young people and those in the prime of their life .
xu jialu , vice chairman of the npc standing committee , attended the discussion held by the chongqing delegation .
during the meeting , li peng cordially shook hands with macao npc deputies .
as today happens to be women 's day , li peng conveyed holiday greetings to female deputies .
t 'ang hsing - ch 'iao , head of the delegation , made an introduction of the delegates and then invited delegates to express their opinions .
deputies huang feng - hwa , yang hsiu - wen , and li ch 'eng - jun , talked about how they felt about the session .
they held : these days , through examining the government 's work report , we felt that our country has achieved great development over the past year .
li peng held : i am very happy to call on you deputies , especially in the macao hall of the great hall of the people .
he added , after macao 's return , macao compatriots elected through voting the deputies of macao special administrative region [ sar ] to the npc . the election was a success , and embodied the principle of opening , justice , fair , and honesty .
it spelled out the fact that under the principle of " one country , two systems , " chinese citizens in macao enjoy the right of administering the state affair according to the law . this is an unprecedented experience for macao .
he noted : since the establishment of the macao sar , the principle of " one country , two systems " and the basic law for macao sar has been thoroughly implemented , and all the work of the sar has been smoothly operated .
the sar government , headed by mr. edmund ho hau wah , administers macao in line with the law , and all work is progressing in an orderly manner .
we believe that with the backup of the great motherland and the 1.2 billion people , macao compatriots will do a good job in running macao , and will also be able to maintain macao 's long - term prosperity and development .
we are full of confidence to macao 's future .
the deputies of macao to the npc should continue to carry forth the glorious tradition of loving the country and macao , and make contributions to the maintenance of macao 's long - term stability and development .
of course , as macao citizens , you can play your role fully in maca 's social affair .
however , you should not intervene in macao sar 's work , and not intervene in the affairs that fall within the scope of the macao sar 's high degree of autonomy .
accompanying chairman li peng to call on macao sar deputies were cheng siwei , vice chairman of the npc standing committee and secretary general he chunlin .
beijing , 8 mar ( zxs ] - - in xinjiang , there are indeed a handful of people engaged in national splittist activities ; and to xinjiang , opposing national splittism is a long - term task .
this is a comment given by abulahat abdurixit , deputy to the national people 's congress and chairman of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region , at a news conference held by the xinjiang delegation this afternoon .
answering questions raised by reporters of agence france - presse and a norwegian television station , abulahat said : xinjiang currently enjoys social stability , national unity , and economic development .
the occasional terrorist activities in xinjiang are carried out by a handful of national splittist elements .
this is not a nationalities nor a religious issue . rather , it is an issue of splitting the country .
the so - called " independent activities " they carry out under the banners of nationality and religion have won no popular support and therefore have been cast aside by the people of various nationalities in xinjiang and smashed every time .
abulahat also said : national splittist activities in xinjiang existed in the past , still exist now , and is also likely to exist in the future .
therefore , the struggle between splittism and antisplittism is a long - term one in xinjiang .
asked whether the large - scale development of western china would change the population patterns of the han nationality and minority nationalities and then affect national unity , abulahat said unequivocally that large - scale development of western china does not mean large - scale migration .
he said : xinjiang has a population of more than 17 million , of whom 62 percent are minority nationalities .
xinjiang 's population growth features mainly natural growth .
in implementing the basic national policy of family planning , the birthrate of minority nationalities is higher than that of the han nationality .
people of various nationalities in xinjiang wholeheartedly welcome other provinces and municipalities to work hand - in - hand with xinjiang and participate and support xinjiang 's large - scale development .
xinjiang 's large - scale development , which is bound to result in rapid economic development and improved living standards in xinjiang , will only further consolidate national unity .
these leading comrades were li tieying , wu bangguo , wu guanzheng , jia qinglin , huang ju , wen jiabao , wu yi , zhou guangzhao , and wang zhongyu .
li tieying said : the state council attaches great importance to the constructive and theoretical role of philosophy and social sciences .
last year , china 's social sciences circle scored notable achievements --53 subjects of study were given state - level awards .
li tieying pointed out : social sciences should go deep in exploring the important theoretical and practical issues concerning building socialism with chinese characteristics , and in studying important strategic issues brought about by the new situation and changes .
in practice , we should actively explore for and gradually build laws in line with social sciences development and a modern system of social sciences institutes that parallels the socialist market economic system .
we should respect the self - development law of the social sciences system , distinguish institutions from research units , and truly treat social sciences research units as scientific research units .
he stressed : we should have a clear understanding of difficulties pertaining to reform . as reform continues to deepen , the more governments at all levels need to do their work meticulously to ensure that reform goes on smoothly .
wu bangguo said : last year , after having overcome various difficulties , state - owned enterprises achieved the best economic results in five years .
over the first two months of this year , the country 's economic situation was not bad and all targets were better attained than the same period of last year . however , we should soberly perceive the existing problems .
he stressed that this year 's difficulties should be more adequately taken into consideration , that we must not be ideologically slack or numb , and that all work should be done in a better and down - to - earth manner .
in merging or reorganizing enterprises and declaring bankruptcy of enterprises , party and government organizations at all levels should bring their roles into full play and do meticulous ideological work among staff members and workers .
beijing definitely will give play to its advantages as the capital of the country , perform its duty , and actively support the great development of the western region .
jia qinglin said : over the last few years , in providing aids for inner mongolia , tibet , and other autonomous regions and provinces in the western region , beijing and these localities have benefited each other , achieved common development , and accumulated precious experience .
in the future , beijing will further give play to its advantages in trained personnel , information , fund , management , and other areas , and bolster support for the implementation of the strategy of carrying out the great development of the western region .
he stressed : carrying out the great development of the western region also will provide a rare opportunity for beijing 's economic and social development .
the western region is vast , has rich resources , is a huge market , and has huge potential .
first , we should speed up infrastructure construction - - this is the foundation for the great development of the western region .
infrastructure construction should be carried out according to a unified plan , key projects should be stressed , and priority should be given to the construction of water control , transportation , communication , and other important projects .
water shortages are a main factor that has constrained development in the western region ; therefore , reasonable exploitation and efficient utilization of water resources should be regarded as a prominent task .
second , we should step up ecological environmental building - - this is the root of the great development of the western region .
while greater efforts are made to implement the project to protect natural forests resources , we should return farmlands to forests and grasslands in ecologically fragile areas in a systematic and planned manner .
third , we should step up efforts to adjust the economic structure - - this is the key to the great development of the western region .
oriented toward market and relying on technological progress , we should develop an economy with local characteristics and industries utilizing local resources .
fourth , we should forcefully develop science and technology education - - this is an important requirement for the great development of the western region .
during her discussion with the guizhou delegation , wu yi pointed out that the western region should have greater consciousness in opening up , boost development making use of opening up , and broaden the scope of opening up taking advantage of great development .
wu yi pointed out : constrained by its geographical location and other conditions , the western region started relatively late in opening up itself .
currently , the most important thing for the western region is to attract investments and funds from other localities and make full and good use of funds from other localities and overseas fund .
in discussing the government work report with the hainan delegation , wu yi said : hainan should make use of the preferential policy for the special economic zone and its unique geographical location to accelerate development of an economy with local characteristics .
in addition , the government also has taken such important measures as quickening the pace of directly financing enterprises and allowing enterprises to merge , declare bankruptcy , and transform their debts into company shares .
to implement the party central committee 's principle , policy , and various plans in a down - to - earth manner , all industries , trades , and concerned departments should truly improve enterprise management , and the key to this is to set strict demands .
the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control policy eventually should be implemented at enterprises and should serve its purpose by means of enterprises . if enterprise management lags behind , it will be difficult for the policy and measures , however good they are , to yield good results .
( by reporter sun jie )
among the leading comrades who joined the discussion of respective delegations were li tieying , wu bangguo , wu guanzheng , jia qinglin , huang ju , wen jiabao , wu yi , zhou guangzhao , and wang zhongyu .
the party central committee and the state council have set a great value on the building of philosophy and social sciences , and on the role of theory , li tieying said .
last year witnessed remarkable results in the fields of social sciences in china , and a total of 53 research topics won national - level awards .
in practice , we should make active explorations in , and gradually establish , a new structure for modern scientific research institutions that conforms to the development law of social sciences and that suits the structure of a socialist market economy .
we should respect the self - development law of the structure of social sciences , make a distinction between administrative units and scientific research institutions , and treat the research institutes of social sciences as real scientific research institutions .
last year , state enterprises achieved the best results in five years , thanks to their efforts to overcome various difficulties in operation , indicated wu bangguo .
during the first two months of this year , the country 's economic situation has been fairly good , and all economic indexes have showed a better performance than the same period last year .
he stressed : we should make a more adequate estimate of this year 's difficulties , never slacken our ideological vigilance , and should do a better job in all aspects of our work in a down - to - earth manner .
when carrying out the practice of enterprise merger , restructuring , and bankruptcy , we should give full rein to the role of party and government organizations at all levels , and be meticulous in conducting the ideological work among workers and staff .
beijing must give play to its advantages as the country 's capital , do its part , and accomplish something in its active support for the large - scale development of the country 's western region .
in the future , beijing will give further play to its advantages in able personnel , information , capital , and management ; and increase the intensity of its support for the large - scale development of the country 's western region .
the large - scale development of the western region has also brought rare opportunities to beijing 's economic and social development , he stressed .
the western region is vast in territory and rich in resources , and enjoys huge market and development potentials .
in infrastructure construction , the western region should draw up a unified plan ; lay stress on key projects ; and give top priority to the construction of major projects in the fields of water conservancy , communication , and telecommunications .
water shortage has been a major factor that hinders the development of the western region , and a rational development and an effective utilization of water resources should therefore be placed on a prominent position .
second , the building of a sound ecological environment should be strengthened , and this serves as a basic condition for the large - scale development of the western region .
at the same time when intensifying the implementation of the project for the protection of natural forest resources , the western region should also introduce the practice of returning grain plots to forestry and grass - raising in a well - planned way step by step .
third , the intensity of readjustment to the country 's economic structure should be stepped up , and this is the key to a successfully large - scale development of the western region .
the western region should take the market as the guide , rely on scientific and technological progresses , and develop a specialty economy and dominant industries of its own .
fourth , the western region should vigorously develop science and technology as well as education , for this is an important precondition for the large - scale development of the western region .
we yi further pointed out : in the past , restricted by its geological locations and other factors , the western region had a late start in the practice of opening up .
at the present moment , the most important task is to attract investment from outside the region , and make an effective use of funds introduced from other parts of the country and the world .
we yi noted : the state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .
when attending the discussion of the hainan delegation , wu yi said that hainan should make use of its policy advantage as a special economic zone as well as its exceptional geological advantages , and accelerate its development of a specialty economy .
besides , the state has also adopted corresponding major measures on speeding up the direct financing pace of enterprises ; and for the implementation of merger , bankruptcy , and the practice of " turning debts to equity . "
with a view to carrying out the principles , policies , and work arrangements established by the central authorities in real terms , all industries and trades as well as all sides should devote real efforts to reinforcing management ; and what counts here is to set strict demands .
it is through enterprises that the state 's macroeconomic policies are to take effect ; therefore , if enterprises fail to keep pace in their management work , no policy or measure can ever yield desired results , however good it may be .

while applauding it in high glee , they also offered opinions calling for stepped - up efforts to gradually suppress corrupt practices .
this morning , after the official announcement was made about the execution of hu changqing , our reporters fanned out to do interviews at places where the npc deputies and cppcc members are stationed .
upon hearing the news , many of them applauded with satisfaction .
in the evening , they all watched tv news on hu changqing 's execution and got the details about the hu changqing case through the " focal interview " program of the central television station .
zhang xusheng , npc deputy and board chairman of the yijianmei [ 0001 0477 2734 ] group company in jiangsu , said : " we must make arrests in carrying out anti - corruption work .
there is a lacking in dynamics . we should execute whoever deserves to be killed , otherwise popular indignation cannot be assuaged , and china 's development will be unattainable . "
at the same time , he pointed out , it is also necessary to start with the system in order to solve the corruption problem once and for all . otherwise , when you arrest someone today , another one or even more than one will emerge tomorrow .
moreover , everybody is equal before the law . anyone committing a crime must be severely punished , no matter how high or low a position he holds .
npc deputies and cppcc members hold that , determination of the central authorities to stamp out corruption truly reflects the wish and demand of the people , as was indicated by the applause in the hall when zhu rongji 's government work report touched on measures again corruption .
member hsu ssu - ming and director of hong kong " ching pao " monthly magazine said in a written statement that it is necessary to establish and perfect a framework for strict rule by law and punish the corrupt who are a bane to the country .
only by doing so will there be the guarantee that all public servants are clean and honest and always in an unassailable position .
to prevent crime at one 's official post is the fundamental approach to suppressing and cutting down corruptive practices by state organ functionaries . it is also a new task of the new period 's campaign against corruption and for honest government .
" the scope for measurement of penalty provided in the ' criminal law ' of china is too wide and not conducive to the prevention of judicial corruption . "

beijing , 9 mar ( xinhua ) - - according to the agenda of the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] , chairman li peng will deliver a report on the work of the npc standing committee to the congress session .
as the permanent organ of npc , the npc standing committee has to deliver a work report to the congress session .
this is an effective form of holding itself responsible to the npc and placing itself under the supervision of the npc . this is also the stipulated requirement of the constitution and law .
since the establishment of npc , the npc standing committee work reports have been delivered by the vice chairman of the npc standing committee .
from 1960 to 1964 , the npc standing committee work reports were delivered to the congress sessions in the form of written reports .
during the " cultural revolution " period , the country 's political life was in a chaotic state and the npc work was in an abnormal situation . during this period , the npc standing committee did not report its work to the congress sessions .
after the third session of the 11th cpc central committee , the npc work was gradually standardized and institutionalized .
at the second session of the fifth npc held in 1979 , the npc standing committee resumed delivering work report to the congress session , but it was still delivered in the form of a written report .
from the third session of the fifth npc in 1980 to the second session of the ninth npc in 1999 , the work reports of the npc standing committee were delivered by the vice chairmen .
on 21 february this year , the chairmanship meeting adopted the deputies ' suggestion of making chairman li peng deliver the npc standing committee report to the third session of the ninth npc .
this was approved by the 14th standing committee meeting of the ninth npc .
as learned by this reporter , many deputies believed that this is a new scene in the work of the people 's congress , having a positive significance in promoting the building of the people 's congress system .
beijing , 9 mar ( xinhua ) - - the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] held its third meeting this morning to hear the work report of the standing committee of the npc and the explanation of the draft law on legislation .
party and state leaders jiang zemin , zhu rongji , li ruihuan , hu jintao , wei jianxing , and li lanqing attended the meeting .
bu he , executive chairman of the npc session and executive member of the presidium of the npc session , chaired the meeting .
it is the first time in the npc 's history that the chairman has delivered the work report of the npc standing committee .
all the previous work reports were delivered by the vice chairmen .
according to the decision of the npc standing committee , gu angran , chairman of the legislative affairs commission of the npc standing committee , made explanations of the draft law on legislation .
the party being the " representative of three aspects " has been determined by our party 's character and guidelines .
as the leadership core of china 's socialist cause , our party is devoted to coordinating and developing socialist material and spiritual civilizations and to achieving comprehensive social progress .
as the loyal representative of the people of various nationalities in china , our party must embody the selfless character of the working class .
apart from the people 's interests , our party has no other interests to pursue .
comrades in the entire party must always uphold the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people and make selfless contributions to materializing , developing , and safeguarding the people 's interests .
the party being the " representative of three aspects " is a summation of historical experience indicating the party 's continuous growth .
historical experience suggests that the party being the " representative of three aspects " is the foundation of the party , the origin of our strength , and the basis of our lives .
the party being the " representative of three aspects " is the practical need to achieve the general objective of the new great project on party building .
the 15th cpc national congress put forward the general objective of the new great project on party building in the new century .
on how to achieve the general objective of party building under new historical conditions , comrade jiang zemin stressed the importance of the party being the " representative of three aspects , " thus providing a clear direction for us to advance .
at the turn of the century , in - depth and complicated changes are taking place in the situation , tasks , and environment our party is facing .
these major and in - depth changes provide us with development opportunities and also pose challenges and tests for our party .
some decadent and backward things left over from history still have certain conditions to exist in the present - day social life and are affecting party members and cadres from time to time .
in face of new contradictions and new problems , we must always remain sober - minded , hold firm to a correct political direction , and gain the initiative in resolving contradictions and problems .
to be the " representative of three aspects , " all levels of party organizations have to meet new and higher demands .
paying attention to one aspect of things to the neglect of others is impermissible , nor is it permissible to score temporary economic development at the expense of spiritual civilization .
to be the " representative of three aspects , " party members have new and higher demands to meet .
through 20 - odd years of reform and opening up , china has made tremendous achievements in economic and social development and the people 's standard of living has also markedly improved .
in present - day china , no achievements can be made at all without the leadership of the party and the socialist road .
to be the " representative of three aspects , " the party 's leading cadres have to meet new and higher demands .
party cadres are the backbones of the party 's cause .
whether the " three requirements " can be put into effect is , in a sense , whether the cpc central committee 's requirements can be met and whether a high - quality cadres contingent can be formed .
all levels of leading cadres should clearly understand their historic responsibilities , stress the importance of study , politics , and righteousness , and set strict demands on themselves .

deputy jia qinglin said : in recent years , the agricultural and rural work in beijing municipality 's suburbs has been full of vitality , and a new situation has been brought about in this regard .
breakthroughs have been made in the reform of the system of property rights , a multiple investment system has initially taken shape , and the rural economy under public ownership has been fresh with vitality .
village and town enterprises have extricated themselves from difficulties through reorganization and restructuring , and they are playing a more important role as pillars .
peasants ' incomes noticeably and quickly increased to percent [ no percentage figure - - as received ] last year , reaching the highest level in recent years .
agricultural and rural development in beijing 's suburbs is giving birth to a quality leap forward .
in the face of the new situation in the market economy , the problem of the lagging structure has become increasingly conspicuous .
town construction is lagging behind , which restricts economic and social development .
development has been made to some extent in recent years , but , overall , the level of town construction in beijing 's suburbs is not high enough , which lags behind its level of economic development and the requirements of social development .
in the face of the new situation in the development of the rural economy in beijing 's suburbs , what measures should beijing take with regard to its agricultural and rural work at present and for some time to come ?
deputy jia qinglin pointed out : first , vigorous efforts should be made to carry out strategic economic restructuring .
it is necessary to be market - oriented and focus on efficiency in cultivating and developing leading industries and creating economic advantages in beijing 's suburbs .
the basic way out for beijing 's suburbs lies in making vigorous efforts to promote the development of secondary and tertiary industries .
we should vigorously optimize the agricultural structure , raise the proportion of animal husbandry and cash crops in agriculture , develop special crop farming and aquaculture , and gradually build beijing 's suburbs into centers for the production of special products and green foods .
in the course of structural readjustment , efforts should be made to increase scientific and technological content by a big margin .
we should improve the scientific and technological level as a basic measure to be vigorously carried out in developing the economy in beijing 's suburbs .
we should encourage scientists and technicians to set up enterprises and contract projects .
we also should make vigorous efforts to improve peasants ' cultural knowledge and their scientific and technological level , to arouse their strong thirst for scientific and technological knowledge , and to make it possible for them to have an ability to use science and technology .
we should further establish the status of household operation and arouse peasants ' long - term enthusiasm .
in this regard , we should implement the party 's rural economic policies to enable peasants to conscientiously and voluntarily take the initiative in making structural readjustment .
meanwhile , we should guide and assist peasants in developing agriculture along specialized lines ; we should vigorously develop specialized townships and specialized villages and improve peasants ' household - operation capacity and level .
second , we should make vigorous efforts to step up town construction .
town construction is an important measure for beijing 's suburbs to reach the level of a moderately developed country in agricultural and rural modernization , and it is also a very arduous task to carry out . 1 .
planning should be done before everything else .
planning will decide on the direction , layout , scale , and functions of town construction and on a series of other questions , which is the first thing to be done .
attention should be focused on forming a rational system of towns and the distribution of villages , which should be conducive to the distribution of industries and population .
we should make planning and carry out construction according to the four levels of satellite , key , and general towns and administrative villages in line with their different functions , requirements , and development targets .
once planning is determined , it must be carried out in earnest and without any willful changes so as to ensure the sustained and healthy development of town construction . 2 .
it is aimed at economic prosperity and population concentration .
a rational industrial structure and solid economic strength constitute an important foundation for the existence and development of towns as well as their basic conditions for forming their strong stimulating ability and for bringing along economic and social development in their areas .
we should pay close attention to environmental construction and make sustainable development .
priority should be given to the development of infrastructure facilities in towns .
in areas where conditions permit , advance arrangements should be in this regard , and room should be left for long - term development .
we should persistently take the people as the principal factor and build new towns with a high - standard design for environmental protection in order to create a beautiful environment with clean air , blue water , and a clear sky .
when asked about the forces that split xinjiang , he pointed out sharply without taboo : reactionary religious forces from abroad are the ones that are engaged in injiang independence , and the united states is an even bigger schemer that plots behind the scene .
he pointed out : some reactionary religious forces abroad cannot bear the sight of china 's development . in order to achieve the goal of " westernizing and splitting china , they have used the two issues of " religions and nationalities to create all kinds of trouble .
beijing , 9 mar - a draft legislative law designed to standardize legislative activities and safeguard uniformity of the state 's legal system was submitted today for deliberation by the third plenary session of the national people 's congress [ npc ] being held here .
in accordance with the decision of the npc standing committee [ npcsc ] , gu angran , chairman of the npcsc 's legal system work committee , explained the draft legislative law to the full session .
the draft legislative law had been deliberated twice earlier by the npcsc .
it is the only bill on law submitted for deliberation by the current npc session .
gu angran said , the legislative law is a law concerning the legislative system of the state .
gu angran said : " to a certain extent , these problems have undermined the uniformity and dignity of the state 's legal system and created difficulties for law enforcement . "
the draft law provides provisions on the legislative authorities of the npc and npcsc , the state council , the provincial people 's congresses and their standing committees , and the minority autonomy areas .
the current practice of having the npc and its standing committee authorize the state council to legislate is reserved in the draft law .
but gu angran said , the authorization scope will be gradually narrowed down as laws are increasingly improved and a more complete legal system is gradually coming into shape .
with regard to legislation procedure , the draft law stipulates that in general the system of three deliberations shall be practiced by the npcsc in reviewing a bill of law .
the draft law also lays down provisions on the principles for enactment procedure for administrative law and regulations and local ordinances , rules and regulations .
the principle for filing a bill on record for deliberation is that it is done only when it is requested .
deqin accountant agency established the first sino - foreign cooperative accountant agency in shanghai in 1992 .
ltd . , the kunming machine tools company , shenzhen express , the shanghai industrial company , and yanzhou mining corporation , and other government departments and large state - owned enterprises are the clients of this accountant agency .
this wednesday , through public bidding , this accountant agency signed a cooperative contract with china 's ministry of finance on providing consulting service for the finance ministry to reformulate the accounting rules .
the world bank has granted loans to china to support this project .
at the signing ceremony , vice minister of finance zhang youcai , said : the reform of the accounting system has played an important role in china 's accession to the wto and enabling the chinese economy to march towards the world .
the npc received delegations send by over 50 countries to china last year , li peng said .
through visits to china , the parliamentary figures of a number of countries had a better idea of china , dispelled their misunderstanding , and increased common understanding .
li peng said : this year , the npc standing committee will inspect the way the organic law of urban neighborhood committees , the land management law , the law on town and township enterprises , and the criminal procedure law are implemented .
it is necessary to further improve the way we conduct inspections by doing away with pomp and circumstance , by going down to the grass - roots level and among the masses , and by stressing practical results and guarding against formalism .
if necessary , we may publish in the news media typical cases of illegal acts found during the course of inspecting law enforcement , so that the broad masses of the people can exercise supervision .
li peng said : all this is aimed at supervising public finance in accordance with the law , at opposing waste and corruption , and at bringing into play the role of public finance in promoting reform and development and in maintaining social stability .
li peng said : the npc standing committee should follow and uphold the principle of the party 's leadership in exercising supervision over judicial and procuratorial work , the principle of not exercising judicial and procuratorial powers by proxy , and the principle of collectively performing supervisory functions .
the purpose of exercising supervision is to spur judicial organs to activate their internal monitoring mechanisms , and to urge judicial and procuratorial organs to handle cases in accordance with the law and administer justice fairly and to support them in this respect .
li peng also called for earnestly examining and entering into official records statutes , regulations on autonomy , and special regulations in accordance with the provisions of relevant laws .
beijing , 8 mar - - state president jiang zemin pointed out that there is no hope for a nation that superstitiously believes in cults .
he pointed out that falungong is a cult , and the central authorities acted correctly in deciding to ban it .
jiang zemin went to the hong kong room in the great hall of the people this morning to attend a discussion meeting of the hong kong delegation . shi zhihui , one of the delegates [ from hong kong precious lotus monastery ] , spoke on the falungong issue .
after shi zhihui spoke , jiang zemin introduced in detail the origin and development of the central government 's decision on banning " falungong " ; he spoke for about 30 minutes .
he said that when " falungong " followers besieged zhongnanhai last 25 april , he drove around zhongnanhai in a jeep to have a look , and also bought relevant books to find out about things .
jiang zemin said that he knows quite a bit about buddhism , and the state respects religious freedom ; there are many temples in china , and he would like to visit them .
master hong yi 's original name was li xutong , and he was famed for poetry , writing , and painting .
master hong yi later passed away in quanzhou , fujian .
jiang zemin said he went to quanzhou once , since he wanted to see the place where master hong yi passed away .
jiang zemin accused " falungong " of being a cult like japan 's aum shinrikyo .
a high - ranking intellectual who had accompanied president jiang on a visit to the former soviet union ended up mentally deranged , with her family broken up , on account of her mistaken belief in " falungong . "
this friend was originally the chief accountant at the changchun automobile plant , but refused to see a doctor when she contracted heart disease , saying that li hongzhi had called her up to heaven ; in the end her family broke up .
jiang zemin pointed out that such affairs were really frightening .
publishing houses in the interior have produced many books about " falungong , " and in addition the reading materials produced for youngsters by certain publishing houses are of poor quality and do harm to the next generation .
president jiang said , " in certain areas , therefore , china has too much freedom [ preceding three words published in english ] because of lack of controls . "
more than 1,000 people in china have died because of their superstitious belief in " falungong . "
he said that there is no hope for a nation that superstitiously believes in these cults , which will cause a very great crisis in the future .
in handling the " falungong " affair , however , he revealed that it was not easy to summon up the resolve , and the decision had only been taken to ban the cult after thorough study and discussion with the central authorities .
jiang zemin said that he had discussed the question of cults with former us president bush .
jiang zemin told him that the situation in china is that these people are mentally normal and they only became abnormal after believing in li hongzhi 's " falungong . "
jiang zemin had also talked about old days with the mayor of san francisco , and asked what would happen if 20,000 people besieged the white house .
when the world trade organization meeting was held in seattle last year , the meeting eventually could not go on because of being besieged by demonstrators .
as a result , the united states used tear gas
jiang zemin made the remark when attending the macao delegate 's examination of the government work report on the afternoon of 8 march .
he expressed the belief that the sar government would make an effective study of those matters and formulate policies , to which the central government will not interfere .
the contract on the monopolized operation of gambling and lottery in macao will expire next year . the sar government will set up an independent committee to study the issue of renewing the gambling contract .
in a recent meeting with the sar chief executive edmund ho , qian qichen also stated that it was up to the macao sar government to decide on the matter of the renewal of gambling contract .
according to ma li , a hong kong - based npc deputy , president jiang zemin made the above remarks after the deputies finished their speeches .
president jiang stated that he has talked about both " river water not interfering with well water " and " well water not interfering with river water " . however , some people in hong kong have only taken what they need .
according to ma li , president jiang also said : in order to enforce and implement the basic law in the hong kong sar , someone has to take the lead .
should such a situation come up , the central authorities shall deal with it in accordance with the provisions of the basic law .
it is a fiscal budget with great foresight .
insofar as international experiences are concerned , the united states began to reduce spending , enhance efficiency , increase scientific and technological investment , and consolidate its foundation and reinforce its internal strength in the 1990s and has attained excellent results .
however , japan has chosen to raise taxes without reducing public spending with the result that the japanese economy has stagnated .
as the hong kong economy has just seen a momentum of recovery , the momentum of recovery would most likely be killed if taxes were to be raised .
the decision on not raising taxes will help disclose whether the current fiscal deficit is a structural one or one caused by an economic cycle .
the theme of the fiscal budget is " scaling new heights , " which is exactly an ardent aspiration shared by some 7 million hong kong residents .
this shows that in a scientifically and technologically developed society marked by knowledge , the entire workforce stands to gain as long as the economy remains vibrant and consumption continues to grow .
now that hong kong 's revenue from land sales and stamp duty has been restored to the level of 1997 , the fiscal deficit is in fact the result of a rise in cost prices of public undertakings and a sharp rise in welfare spending .
however , prices of private undertakings have fallen during the same period . this is why the government revenue has fallen and its operating expenses have risen sharply at a rate higher than that of gdp for three years running .
this situation calls for redoubled efforts to " cut spending . "
one year ago , the government mapped out a civil service structural reform plan , which has helped cut spending .
the 1999 fiscal deficit went down by a large margin thanks in part to some hkd10.7 billion of spending " cut " by the government .
in the fiscal budget , the government has pledged to cut an additional 617 positions this year and another 10,000 civil service positions over the next three years with an eye on reducing its staff size to the level of the year 1995 .
in future , the government will urge more private institutions to take part in public services apart from changing its way of thinking and improving its service quality .
the government move aimed at " cutting spending " will help cultivate the image of the government staying together with the public in a period of difficulties and will ensure concerted efforts from the government and the public in pushing forward an economic recovery .
the fiscal budget proposed that a significant amount of public funds and resources " thus saved " be allocated to tide three groups of people over their difficulties .
as for the first group of people , namely , the young people who have just left schools and have since remained jobless , the government plans to provide them with vocational training .
as for the third group of people , namely , elderly people who have no one to rely on , the government plans to provide them with more comprehensive assistance and care - for - the - elderly services .
the residents have seen that " spending cut " has lowered the cost of public undertakings without sacrificing their service quality and increased the funds for negotiating public difficulties .
beijing , 8 mar ( wen wei po ) - - amudun niyaz , chairman of the standing committee of the xinjiang autonomous regional people 's congress , disclosed here today that the rebiya kadeer case will soon be closed .
amudun niyaz said : rebiya is suspected of providing intelligence to foreign countries , sabotaging national unity , subverting the government and endangering state security , and now the evidences are conclusive .
no similar incident of violence has occurred recently . there have been only such activities as distributing leaflets and writing letters of threat , but they were immediately reported to the authorities by the masses .
abulahat abdurixit , chairman of the xinjiang autonomous region , said : in xinjiang , the anti - splittist struggle exists objectively . it existed for a long time in the past and is likely to happen again in the days to come .
abulahat abdurixit said : now , the various nationalities in xinjiang are united and the people want development and stability .
the activities of a handful of splittists cannot affect the large - scale development of the western region , nor can they affect xinjiang 's economic development .
amudun niyaz believes that if xinjiang is to participate in the large - scale development of the western region , it has to import technology and hire specialized personnel from outside xinjiang and its population may somewhat increase .
to represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .
chinese communists are born and destined to serve the people wholeheartedly .
the grasp of power , ruling , reform , opening up , and emancipating and developing the productive forces are all done for the people .
this has also become the life of chinese communists , and it is where their strength lies .
the power in our hands can only be used to serve the people . it cannot be used to seek private gain or for the interests of a group , a small group , or the minority .
doing everything for the people and relying on the people for everything are two important aspects of representing and realizing the fundamental interests of the people ; they cannot be separated .
this requires that the lines and policies we formulate and all the deeds we perform be in keeping with the laws of science and subjective reality , and in keeping with the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .
to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , one must concentrate on developing productive forces and create more material and spiritual wealth .
by comprehensively strengthening all work in the party , we must make the party younger , more united , and give it more power to fight .
the situation of commodity shortages , which existed a long time in china , have already fundamentally changed . this is a tremendous achievement .
it has become the urgent task now to conduct in - depth studies and quickly solve the problem concerned with adjusting economic structure .
if this task is not quickly accomplished , we will lose the initiative in future intensive international competition .
structural adjustment must be planned in a unified manner .
in this adjustment we must pay special attention to the role of the market in resource distribution and on no account go back to the old methods and old models of a planned economy .
with an increasingly intensified global market competition , in order to strengthen china 's economic development potential and guarantee long - term development , we must rely on the progress of science , technology and innovation .
at the same time , we must accelerate the turning of science and technological research into actual productive forces .
we must strengthen and improve management throughout society for the strict scientific management system and mechanism in all fields .
in solving income distribution problems , we must adhere to a system of allowing different forms to co - exist while having distribution according to labor as the main form .
on the one hand , we must adhere to the priority of efficiency while giving consideration to fairness . this is good for optimizing resource distribution , can promote economic development , and maintain social stability .
on the other hand , with the development of the economy , we must continuously improve the life of the broad masses of workers , farmers , intellectuals , and cadres , and gradually get rich together .
we must adopt corresponding policy measures to protect legal income , regulate income that is excessively high , ban illegal income , prevent polarization in income distribution , and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses .
china is a large agricultural country . we must always pay attention to strengthening and consolidating the fundamental position of agriculture .
we must continue to stabilize the party 's rural policy , and emphasize the adjustment of agricultural and rural economic structure .
under the premise of not letting go of grain production , we must adjust the structure of agricultural produce , actively develop diversified businesses , develop town and township enterprises , and develop tertiary industries in the countryside .
at the same time we must strengthen the building of rural infrastructure and improve production conditions in agriculture and the ecological environment .
we must ensure the building of a social security system .
this is both an urgent requirement for accelerating structural adjustment and deepening economic reform and an objective requirement for maintaining social stability and realizing the long - term peace of the nation .
in facing the trend toward economic globalization , we must take part actively and be clever in protecting ourselves , and strive to turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones .
we must fully understand the opportunities and challenges facing china 's economy after china joins the wto , take active measures so that we can grasp the opportunities and use them , and welcome the challenges and win them .
he also said that if taiwan pursues " independence , " this will mean " what need each the other fry , " because the compatriots on both sides of the strait are " sprung from the same stalk . "
jiang zemin attended full group discussions held this morning by the macao and hong kong delegations .
before the discussions started , he specifically answered reporters ' questions on the motherland reunification issue .
the questions and answers follow : ( while meeting the macao delegation ) reporter : president jiang , will " the beacons blaze for three moons ? "
jiang zemin : " the beacons blaze for three moons , a letter from home is worth ten thousand pieces of gold . " are you quoting from du fu 's poem ?
looking at the present , it is not at all the feeling that you speak of , our guideline is consistent and extremely specific , and there is no change at all .
reporter : president jiang , this is the first time that a macao delegation has come to beijing for the two sessions , is this of important significance ?
jiang zemin : naturally it is important . macao 's reversion to the motherland on 20 december last year was an event of tremendous joy , and this is the first time ( macao has formed a delegation to attend ) the national people 's congress .
( while meeting the hong kong delegation ) reporter : did you just say that there will be no cross - strait war ?
jiang zemin : our guideline regarding taiwan is consistent , " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems , " but if there is interference by interventionist forces , we will naturally take steps . this is a complete sentence .
reporter : the three leading candidates in the taiwan election say that if elected they will be willing to visit the mainland , would you welcome them ?
jiang zemin : in fact , regarding this issue , i have made it plain in several speeches that we will welcome at any time all those who uphold one china .
reporter : what if a person who supports taiwan independence is elected ?
jiang zemin : questions like this i will ask back , what do you thing will happen ?
reporter : if cross - strait war indeed breaks out , will this not be a case of " what need each the other fry ? "
jiang zemin : fortunately i like poetry , you are probably quoting from a poem of cao zhi : " beans in flame that beanstalks feed , out from the pan cry , 'sprung from the same stalk , what need each the other fry ? ' "
my understanding is that if someone pursues " taiwan independence " and a situation of " what need each the other fry " emerges , it will have been caused by them .
" sprung from the same stalk " means from one china , so why do they need to pursue taiwan independence ? ( applause ) reporter : are you afraid of foreign intervention ?
because some people say that the united states wants to turn taiwan into its " unsinkable aircraft carrier , " what is your view ?
jiang zemin : i think that i have spoken on this question with many international leaders , including american and japanese leaders , what was the source ( of this phrase ) ?
reporter : do you think there is much chance of reaching a cross - strait ( consensus ) on one china ?
jiang zemin : i am an optimist , i believe that we will ultimately reunify this great chinese nation .
reporter : are you afraid of foreign intervention then ?
jiang zemin : are you saying that we should rely on foreign pressure to achieve reunification ?
reporter : i am asking if you are afraid of foreign intervention ?
jiang zemin : the chinese people have never been afraid of evil things ! ( applause , laughter ) reporter : will you see the new taiwan leader ?
jiang zemin : what did you say , i could not hear .
if i go on talking i will be affecting your ( hong kong delegation ) discussion , and it will also be turning into a news conference .
reporter : do you hope to go to taiwan ?
jiang zemin : naturally i hope to go .
reporter : when ?
jiang zemin : that depends on the circumstances , do you think i could go in these ( today 's ) circumstances ?
effectively reducing the excessive schoolwork burden on primary and middle school students is a need in training high - quality modern personnel .
following continuous social development , however , the original system and methods for education have become increasingly incompatible with the requirements of the modernization drive , and the examination - oriented education is met with an increasingly narrow path .
the defects in the current education and some problems that wake us up to reality as pointed out in general secretary jiang zemin 's speech are compound symptoms of the excessive burden on primary and middle school students .
educational management departments , schools , and teachers hold the key to reducing the burden but not the quality .
good teachers are able to make thick books " thin " in their teaching , but bad teachers make thin books " thick . "
the large numbers of teaching and administrative staff on the educational front have worked hard and brought up group after group of outstanding personnel for developing the motherland over a long period of time , thanks to the guidance of the party 's educational policy .
in the relations between giving education and receiving education , educational departments and schools play a major role .
the endeavor to reduce the excessive schoolwork burden on primary and middle school students requires the support from all quarters of society and everyone 's effort to create a good social environment for this endeavor .
comrades from many educational management departments and schools said that not only primary and middle school students , but also the government and the parents should " reduce the burden , " and the entire society should create a good atmosphere for " reducing the burden . "
in reducing the excessive schoolwork burden on primary and middle school students , we should both be firm and pay attention to avoid letting one tendency conceal another .
what we want to reduce is the excessive and unnecessary burden on students . we do not mean that students should not have any schoolwork burden .
primary and middle school students will bear the heavy burden of the modernization drive on all fronts after five or 10 years .
" studying hard for the tomorrow of the motherland " should become the conscious deed of every student who has lofty ideals and ambitions .
reducing the excessive schoolwork burden on primary and middle school student never means to reduce and cancel the necessary tests and examinations .
the various effective methods to inspect students ' academic study and to examine and assess their mastery of knowledge remain effective and necessary .
during the special historical period of the " great cultural revolution , " our educational reform made a detour , and examinations were canceled , resulting in a lack of replacement of a whole generation of trained personnel .
the party 's educational principle is to train the outstanding personnel with all - round development of morality , intelligence , and physique who meet the needs of socialist modernization drive .
general secretary jiang zemin 's important speech discussed education from the strategic perspective of the rise and fall of the state and the rejuvenation of the nation .
jia qinglin , deputy to the npc session , said that beijing should exert efforts to study and resolve three major questions in the year 2000 .
first , great efforts should be made to develop new high - technology industries and to facilitate the strategic readjustment of the economic structure .
in line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .
with regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network - based information service industries .
second , great efforts should be made to promote the reform and development of state - owned enterprises and to set up a socialist market economic system .
the year 2000 is the last year , as well as a decisive year to realize the goal of reforming state - owned enterprises and lifting them out of their difficulties in three years .
it is necessary to achieve various auxiliary reforms , including the setup and improvement of a social security system and the implementation of the re - employment project ; and to make essential headway in " reducing debts , the staff , and burdens . "
third , great efforts should be made to improve and develop the environment and to comprehensively upgrade the modernization levels of the urban construction and management .
synopsis : - - large - scale development of the west is a key strategy of our country 's cross - century macroeconomic development that is of vital significance .
- - large - scale development of the west is a magnificent project that requires overall planning and all - round consideration as well as long - term struggle , that must adhere to certain basic principles .
- - large - scale development of the west has a bearing on the overall situation ; great efforts should be made to support it in such things as policy , system , capital , and talent , together with comprehensive planning and step - by - step implementation .
the western part of our country is a vast territory with rich natural resources and huge development potential .
but since reform and opening up , the economic development of the west has been relatively slow , leading to a wider gap with the economy of the east .
the economic discrepancy and contradiction between the east and the west has become an outstanding issue of our country 's macroeconomic operation .
at present , with the enhancement of our country 's economic strength , speeding up the development of the west is not only of vital significance but the condition is also ripe .
speeding up the development of the west helps boost the economic strength of the west , narrow the gap between regional economies , and harmonize regional economic development .
over the past 10 years , owing to the government 's moderately preferential macroeconomic policy , the economy of the west has been growing at a markedly improved rate , with certain important indexes even higher than that in the east .
however , an undeniable fact is that the economic gap between the east and the west is getting wider and wider .
for example , from 1978 to 1997 , as far as the proportion to the nationwide gdp is concerned , the east was up from 52 percent to 61.4 percent , while the west was down from 17 percent to 14.8 percent .
the gap in per capita gdp is also getting wider and wider .
in the early days of reform and opening up , the per capita gdp of northwestern provinces and regions was higher than that of fujian , and the figure of qinghai was even higher than that of guangdong .
but in 1997 , the nationwide per capita gdp was 6,392 yuan , while the per capita gdp of the west was merely 4,009 yuan , which was about 62.7 percent of the national average .
in 1998 , the per capita gdp of guangdong and fujian exceeded 10,000 yuan , while for the five northwestern provinces and regions , only xinjiang reached 6,435 yuan , but the rest were less than 4,500 yuan , and the difference was over 100 percent .
since reform and opening up , proceeding from the actual conditions of our country , letting some of the regions get rich first has been an absolutely correct policy to pursue .
but our goal is to achieve common prosperity .
unexploited land throughout the territory is close to 800 million acres , so there is huge potential for development .
they also have very rich tourism resources .
speeding up development of the west can facilitate rational allocation and flow of all kinds of resources and provide much room and huge driving force for the development of the national economy .
hence , in order to display the superiority of the west , fully utilize natural resources , bring about rational division of labor between regions , and strengthen the development momentum of the national economy , speeding up development of the west is truly essential .
speeding up development of the west helps increase domestic demand .
by the end of 1999 , the factory price index of production means and the overall retail price level of social consumables have dropped for 27 consecutive months .
social demands , including demands for investment , consumption , and export , are the key factor that stimulates economic growth .
our country is a big nation , the contribution rate of domestic demand to economic growth is far higher than export demand .
in particular , under the current situation of extremely fierce competition in the international market , a growing number of factors of price uncertainty , and volatile market changes , taking the expansion of domestic demand as the mainstay is also an important measure to lower economic risks .
speeding up development of the west helps increase domestic demand .
speeding up development of the west helps raise the material and cultural living standard of residents in the west .
at present , there is a fairly large gap between the material and cultural living standard of urban and rural residents in the west and their counterparts in the east .
large - scale development of the west will certainly quicken the pace of economic growth in the west , increase local urban and rural residents ' job opportunities and earnings , and create conditions for improving residents ' material and cultural lives .
our country is a multi - national state , whereas the west is a territory inhabited by minority nationalities .
economic development is the material foundation of social stability , political unity , and strong ethnic cohesiveness .
the basic principles of development of the west large - scale development of the west is an undertaking of great strategic significance and a cross - century project that requires overall planning and all - round consideration , as well as long - term struggle .
smash the limitations of the theory of economic and technological evolution , dare to develop by leaps and bounds .
for a long time , the concept of evolution has been popular , holding that economic and technological development can only proceed from the east to the west step by step .
this is the mode of thinking shaped under the conditions of a planned economy .
under the conditions of a planned economy , regional economic development relies entirely on the state 's investment and policy support and can only evolve according to the state 's set plan .
however , under the conditions of a market economy , there is no need for any of the regions to " wait " and " rely on others , " they can totally depend on their own strength , and seize the opportunity to develop at a faster pace .
whoever can seize the opportunity to bring its superiority into play can develop faster than others , or even surpass economically developed areas and develop by leaps and bounds .
take reform as the axis of the overall situation , vigorously quicken the pace of reform .
some people hold that economically backward areas should also lag behind in reform .
this is not law .
so in order to speed up development , reform must be expedited .
in reforming the state - owned economy , we should uphold the practice of going ahead in certain areas while backing off from others , take concrete measures to gradually withdraw from spheres that can be withdrawn , and make an inventory of state - owned assets .
to speed up reform , we must , first of all , change the way people think , particularly changing the way leading cadres think .
reform will bring about some new problems and new contradictions , or even infringe on certain people 's interests .
but if there is no reform and no economic development , there will be even more problems and more intense contradictions , and not only the interests of certain people but also the interests of the overwhelming majority that will be infringed upon .
reform of course brings risks , but there will be greater risks if we do not reform or put off reform .
hence , as far as large - scale development of the west is concerned , we must reform with greater intensity and promote development with reform .
stick to the two opening - up drives , be simultaneously open to other parts of the country and to foreign countries .
in the new century , the process of economic globalization will keep accelerating .
with its rich natural and labor resources and vast market , the west is very attractive to foreign investors .
to speed up development of the west , the government has to implement policies of foreign investment that are even more preferential than in the east , so as to attract more foreign capital .
at the same time , we must also attach great importance to investment from the east .
we must not only give preferential policy treatment to foreign investors but also to investors from the east and from the central part of the country . we must not only give preferential policy treatment to the public economic sector but also to the non - public economic sector .
to develop the west , we must not only utilize foreign resources and markets , but also utilize the resources and markets of the east and of the central part of the country .
sticking to the two opening - up drives is a must for speeding up development of the west .
vigorously develop the non - public economic sector .
the non - public economic sector is an important component of the socialist market economy .
vigorously developing the non - public economic sector is a must for speeding up development of the west and is of vital significance .
enable market - oriented development of the economy of the west in accordance with the law of market economy .
now as far as large - scale development of the west is concerned , we should never repeat what " remote - area " construction did but should rely on the propelling force of the market .
however , we must also stress that development of the west is a key strategic plan and the government also plays a vital role in it .
as proven by the experience of the united states and some other countries , in the development process of backward areas , government support in such respects as planning , coordination , policy - making , and funding is very essential .
integrating the " invisible hand " with the " visible hand " helps quicken the pace of development of the west .
attach equal importance to speed and quality , focus mainly on quality improvement .
speed is important to development of the west .
the economic gap between the east and the west is being widened , precisely because since reform and opening up , the development pace of the west has been far slower than that of the east .
hence , it is wrong to neglect the pace of development .
however , to develop the west , we cannot go after the pace of development alone , we should rather integrate the development pace with the improvement of economic quality .
protect the environment and resources , bring about sustainable development .
in developing the west , we must attach importance to protecting the environment and resources , upholding ecological equilibrium , and bring about sustainable development .
development of the west is a long - term undertaking , the establishment of a socialist market economic system , economic modernization , and the very improvement of the material and cultural living standard of urban and rural residents cannot be done in a short while .
hence , we must conduct in - depth investigations and studies , work out a general program , and implement it step by step .
we must seize the day , guard against negative waiting and inertia , yet we cannot act with undue haste , neither can we advance rashly against objective law .
vigorously develop infrastructure such as communications and transportation , communication networks , water and power supply , improve the investment environment .
the west is quite far away from economically developed areas , with a low density of railways and highways .
inconvenient transportation is an important factor conditioning economic development .
in the 21st century , information will play a bigger and bigger role in economic development .
the information popularization rate in the west is lower than the national average .
hence , out of the greater investment in infrastructure , greater investment in the information industry is really essential .
develop the undertakings of education and science , improve workforce and talent quality .
according to statistics , the number of undergraduates in the west is higher than the national average , but the distribution is so uneven that the number is lower than the national average if chongqing and xinjiang are not counted .
since reform and opening up , the outflow of talent has been very prominent phenomenon in the west .
this kind of situation causes both joy and anxiety .
it is a joyful thing that through the flow of talent , qualified personnel can fulfill themselves and achieve a higher quality ; yet it is also a cause for concern as there is a shortage of talent for the development of the west .
some of the western provinces , such as shaanxi and sichuan , are relatively strong in science and technology and have a fairly large number of scientific and technological achievements .
the question at present is to translate scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces , translate laboratory superiority into productive superiority , translate product superiority into market superiority , translate market superiority into superiority for better returns , and translate domestic superiority into international superiority .
exchange resources for capital , raise funds for development .
a key problem for developing the west is insufficient funds .
viewed from the current situation , greater government investment is necessary but has little potential , also it does not conform to what is demanded by the law of market economy if we totally rely on government investment .
hence , local fund - raising is the principal way .
but due to economic backwardness , capital accumulation is so slow that it is difficult to meet the demand for rapid development .
the west is rich in resources ; swapping resources for capital and technology is a key option .
for example , in such respects as land utilization , resources exploitation , efforts should be made to offer investors with preferential terms , in a bid to attract investors from other parts of the nation and from foreign countries .
in this way , it will of course bring losses to the local economies .
but no policy measure can possibly be perfect ; as long as the gains are greater than the losses and the advantages outweigh the disadvantages , then it can be taken .
whether we are talking about the economic development of the west or of the whole nation , the advantages of speeding up the development of the west by exchanging resources for capital and technology certainly outweigh the disadvantages .
give stronger financial support to development of the west .
finance is the nucleus of a modern economy .
to develop the economy of the west , we must pay full attention to the financial market and make use of it .
reform the household registration management system , facilitate a flow of workforce and talent .
to speed up development of the west , we must quicken the pace of industrialization and urbanization .
peasants ' city - going practice and transformation of some of the rural workforce into urban workforce are the inevitable tendencies of economic development , and an important sign of social progress as well .
the existing household registration management system neither meets the demands of a market economy nor the needs for development of the west , and policy revisions and breakthroughs should be made .
speed up small town construction .
since reform and opening up , our country has achieved remarkable success in small town construction .
in 1979 , there were only 2,656 organic towns [ jian zhi zhen 1696 0455 6966 ] throughout the country ; by the end of 1998 , the number of organic towns nationwide rose to 19,216 , up 6.23 times .
organic towns have a population of approximately 170 million , making up 45.94 percent of the urban population .
small town construction , because of its small investment , can bring into play the enthusiasm of every sector , which also helps overcome the " city disease " and the " rural disease " and prepare the ground for the balanced development of urban and rural areas .
first , since the introduction of the reform and opening - up policy , china 's nominal tariffs have constantly kept a downward trend .
china has reduced its average tariff from 43.2 percent in 1992 to 17 percent at present , thus showing its firm and consistent efforts in this regard .
thereby , such a situation will not abruptly be changed whether china " joins the wto " or not .
instead of disasters , a sound development of the economy was brought to china through its sustained efforts to cut the nominal tariffs over the past eight years .
second , 17 percent of our country 's current nominal tariff rates are still 10 percent higher than those of the developing countries and three percent more than those of the developed countries .
however , not one wto member state 's economy has ever seriously been impacted just owing to the application of the internationally fairly low tariff rates .
third , since our country 's tariff system is not perfect enough , the higher nominal tariffs relatively cannot give much protection to our domestic economy . in 1998 , china 's effective tariff was only 7.9 percent .
thus , it is obvious that the key to protecting the domestic economy lies in the perfect tariff system , but not the maintenance of high nominal tariffs .
first , china currently occupies the first few positions in the world in terms of the output of some major industrial products . but , its industrial growth forms are still based on consumption of natural resources .
second , the distribution of interests among the industries at home is not reasonable . some of our industries with strong international competitiveness , such as the textile industry , once comprehensively experienced losses while at the same time some trades without international competitiveness witnessed " profits . "
the third misunderstanding is that some people maintain that china 's efforts to open the banking and insurance industries step by step will constitute a serious threat to china 's finance .
as of the end of 1999 , foreign - funded banks established 157 branches in china and registered 13 banks with the chinese authorities . seven foreign - funded financial companies and 248 banking agencies were set up .
so , further opening up our banking sector to the outside world in the next few years will affect both chinese - and foreign - funded banking institutions .
in short , we must neither excessively exaggerate nor be blindly optimistic about the possible impact of the " wto entry " on china 's economy . on the basis of objective analyses , we should calmly cope with the situation , grasp favorable opportunities , and meet challenges .
li peng said upholding party leadership in the npc 's work is entirely in line with giving full play to the role of the organ of state power .
in the same way , upholding party leadership is also entirely in keeping with handling affairs according to law and safeguarding the sanctity of the constitution and other laws .
practice has proved that understanding and handling matters in this way will not weaken the npc 's supervision work , but instead , will improve and strengthen such work and will help better realize the goal of the npc 's supervision .
li peng pointed out that strengthening ties with the people and closely adhering to the mass line in work are required by the nature of our country , a socialist country , as well as by the system of the people 's congresses .
in the past two years , the people have been extremely concerned about , and have given great support to , the work of the npc standing committee .
so long as we continue to fully depend on the people , the standing committee will have a solid mass foundation for its work , will be able to really represent the people 's will , and will maintain exuberant vitality .
li peng said many laws formulated by the npc standing committee have condensed the painstaking practice of local people 's congresses over many years .
the laws approved by the standing committee also depend on local people 's congresses for their correct and effective implementation .
therefore , strengthening ties with local people 's congresses , and constantly improving the work of the npc standing committee through seriously summing up the experience in work of local people 's congresses is the objective demand in promoting the building of the socialist democracy and legal system .
at the same time , the chinese government 's determination to safeguard the country 's unification , sovereignty and territorial integrity is very firm , and it will never allow any force to split taiwan from china in any way .
these two speeches and one document have evoked strong repercussions and attracted universal attention in taiwan as well as in the international community as a whole .
the article says since 1979 , the motherland always hoped to realize peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait through holding talks and has shown the greatest sincerity .
over 130 countries of the world have reaffirmed their adherence to the one - china policy .
all this has created favorable conditions for developing the cross - strait relations in future .
this shows the motherland has all along been considering cross - strait dialogues and talks in future , and has tried to include in the topics for discussion as many of the issues the taiwan people and the taiwan authorities are concerned about as possible .
when conditions are ripe , the motherland is willing to resume cross - strait dialogue and talks on the basis of the one - china principle .
the article points out that the speeches of general secretary jiang zemin and vice premier qian qichen and the white paper have clearly expressed the solemn and just attitude of opposing " taiwan independence " and opposing any activity to split up china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
if the evolution of the politics in taiwan leads to taiwan independence , it will only mean igniting the fuse of a cross - strait war .
for the sake of the interests of all the chinese , including the taiwan compatriots , it is imperative to stop " taiwan independence " and strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification .
settling the taiwan issue to realize the complete reunification of the motherland is the sacred mission of the chinese people .
not allowing the taiwan issue to be indefinitely put off is our consistent stand .
comrade deng xiaoping spoke about this viewpoint on many occasions .
in conclusion , the article says at the turn of the century , it is of utmost importance to maintain the development of the cross - strait relations toward peaceful reunification .
each of us chinese must work hard for this and strive to realize the motherland 's complete reunification at an early date .
in an npc standing committee work report to the meeting , li peng spoke on the npc standing committee legislative work for the upcoming year .
li said that the npc standing committee should first focus on the state 's central task and further integrate legislative work with major policy decisions on state reform , development , and stability .
to this end , it will further study the revision of the company law in order to meet the needs of the reform and development of state enterprises .
it will also expedite relevant departments ' drafting of the social insurance law to promote the establishment and improvement of a legal system for china 's social security and to maintain social stability .
it will step up legislation in education and science and technology to promote the implementation of a general plan for reinvigorating the nation through science and education .
in light of the needs for reform and development , the standing committee will also draft the antimonopoly and antidumping laws , amend the trademark and patent laws , and enact and revise laws related to the financial service sector and international trade and economies .
li peng noted that efforts should be concentrated on drafting and examining several basic bills .
on the basis of individual legal documents concerning relevant supervision work , the npc should sum up practical experience and intensify the drafting of the supervision law .
it will strive to complete the amendment to the regional national autonomy law this year .
it will speed up the drafting of the property rights and state asset laws and will establish and improve a socialist property rights system with chinese characteristics .
it will also step up efforts to amend the marriage law to safeguard equal , harmonious , and civilized family relationships and promote socialist spiritual civilization and social progress .
on the basis of complete individual laws on the civil subject , property rights , obligation , intellectual property rights , and marriage and family systems , the npc standing committee will strive to compile a relatively complete civil code during its term of office .
to complete arduous legislative tasks , li added , it is necessary to standardize legislative activities and constantly raise the efficiency and quality of legislative work .
in legislative work , it is essential to prevent the impact of departmental interests and local protectionism and to safeguard the unity of the socialist legal system .
in accordance with the limits of legislative authority and procedures as prescribed by law , the npc should earnestly carry out legislative work and strengthen guidance , supervision , and coordination in legislative planning and the implementation of annual legislative plans .
as to the laws that have a direct bearing on popular interests , it should continue to announce draft bills in newspapers and solicit opinions from all sides .
it should also sum up the standing committee 's experience in examining draft bills , improve the system for the three - deliberations of important draft bills , and unceasingly raise the quality of deliberations .
while enacting new laws , it should actively carry out legislative interpretation as an important supplementary form of legislation .
party and state leaders jiang zemin , zhu rongji , li ruihuan , hu jintao , wei jianxing , and li lanqing attended the meeting .
the report was previously delivered by a vice chairman .
li peng pointed out that in the past year the standing committee has assigned an important position to supervisory work , attaching equal importance to legal supervision and work supervision , thus strengthening the practical effects of supervision .
the standing committee has arranged the drafting and examination and discussion of three single - item regulations and decisions on supervisory work , launched four checks of law enforcement , and listened to five reports on specialized topics .
li peng said that in the past year the standing committee has attached importance to dealing with the motions , suggestions , criticisms , and views put forward by the deputies .
handling of all the 229 motions put forward by the deputies at the second session of the ninth npc has been completed , and many of their views have been accepted .
the standing committee has also strengthened links with the masses ; during the year it received overt 60,000 letters from the masses , received over 10,000 visits from them , and investigated and dealt with the problems reflected in their letters and visits .
he also spoke on the standing committee 's external work during the past year .
li peng pointed out that it is two years since the ninth npc standing committee was composed .
continue to intensify supervisory work and pay attention to its practical effects .
seriously implement the standing committee decisions on stepping up examination and supervision of the central budget and strengthening supervision over economic work .
strengthen supervision over judicial and procuratorate work .
apart from that , it is necessary to seriously do a good job in putting on record and examining rules and regulations , autonomy regulations , and special regulations .
in accordance with the decision of the npc standing committee , gu angran , director of the npc standing committee 's legal system work committee , delivered an explanation to the meeting on draft legislation .
he said that the law on legislation is an important law concerning the state 's legislative system .
china has achieved notable success and accumulated much experience in legislative work since 1979 , but there are also a number of problems in actual work .
underwater great wall on 14 february , two submarines under a certain submarine detachment of north china sea fleet set out on an emergency mission and quietly disappeared on the vast , deep sea .
this detachment is a heroic unit which accomplished several major missions , including the launching of carrier rockets underwater ; it is also called an underwater great wall defending the republic .
challenges reach the limits the submarines " drew " a deep breath and " abruptly " jumped deep to the bottom of the sea .
the officers and men of the detachment could not clearly remember how many underwater long voyages they had ever made . but they knew that this voyage was a test for their maximum self - sufficiency capabilities and that it would be an abnormal underwater " marathon . "
unlike the previous long voyages crossing the pacific ocean , this would be the longest and farthest underwater voyage in the history of china 's conventional submarines .
this was a test to assess the maximum self - sufficiency capacities of the weapons , equipment , and crew of these two submarines .
under the conditions that the submarines had no supplies and the crew could not take a rest , the weapons and equipment should operate at full capacity , and the crew would meet extra - ordinarily , extreme challenges for both their willpower and bearing capabilities .
when running submerged , the crew lived a " complete dark life . "
the temperature in the submarines was always 34 celsius degrees .
and , the dirty air within the submarines caused much suffering to the crew .
the submarines that were isolated from the atmosphere relied only on the air regenerated by machines , and the air could not circulate within the submarines . so , all kinds of smells would stay uncirculated within the submarines for a long time .
so , during the long voyage , the crew were not allowed to eat any kinds of food with " strong flavors " , or even to use perfumed soaps .
although the submarines were surrounded by water , the crew had to economize on water .
only a small cup of water could be used by each person a day to wash one 's face , brush teeth , wash feet , and drink . even the top officer liu guangyou , chief of the detachment , was no exception .
when washing hands before meals , the crew had to put their hands in the medicinal liquid prescribed by the military doctors . they had to put their dirty clothes in a tightly enclosed plastic bags lest their smell should spread .
liu guangyou told the reporters that before the long voyage , each of the crew should prepare at least four or five sets of underwear because submarine soldiers could not wash their clothes during the long journey .
on the threshold of returning to the base , all the crew were looking forward to returning to the land .
just at that moment , the commanding group sent a direction - - " continuing the long voyage for another five days . "
liu guangyou , a senior submarine officer who had fought on the sea for 30 years , clearly understood that after a ten - odd - day long voyage , the bearing capabilities of both the equipment and the crew had reached the limits .
so , staying longer for another one minute under water would be several dozen times more dangerous than the ordinary times . calamities happened in foreign countries for several times due to the weariness of the crew and the wear - out failures of the equipment after long voyages .
the officers and men , under the leadership of liu guangyou , won first place in terms of the time duration and distance of the voyages by china 's conventional submarines and the number of items that had been tested and assessed .
according to the comments by the specialists , the underwater " marathon " was by no means a report back on consuming strength , but it was a miracle created with conviction and will .
whales play tricks concealment is the life of submarines and where the charm of the life on submarines lies .
the farther the submarines run , the more important concealment becomes .
during a drill , a certain submarine was clearly discovered by a fishing boat nearby as soon as it broke the surface .
so , after hearing the news , anti - submarine helicopters and warships immediately attacked the submarine just like catching a turtle in a jar .
thus , the submarine which had always been arrogant could not but submit . these two submarines which were going through the assessment test were heading for a complicated sea area . could it run submerged during the entire course ?
at zero hours in the midnight , the submarines ran submerged under a complicated sea area . machinery and power systems gave a warning - - " the hydraulic pressure system was out of order . "
this system is a " nervous " system for controlling and regulating the balance of submarines . once it does not work , the submarine will sink to the bottom of the sea like a piece of iron .
if the submarines had broken surface for repairs , they would unexpectedly have encountered warships and then their test missions would have completely failed .
time went by second by second . the submarines could neither break surface nor stay under water . the key technicians did not give any help after 10 hours ' attempts .
the hydraulic pressure system eventually returned to normal 14 hours later .
unlike nuclear submarines , the conventional submarines , after a certain period of running , must break the surface to " charge batteries . "
as soon as the submarines broke surface on a certain sea area , an anti - submarine helicopters flew over it . so , the submarines immediately went deep into the water for concealment .
after the anti - submarine helicopters flew away , the submarines once again broke surface . this time , an unidentified warship appeared on the nearby sea area .
so , they could not help but run submerged . passive concealment was not the best plan for the submarines . how could the submarines gain the initiative in the face of the conflict between concealment and pursuit ?
submarines ' concealment is inseparable from sonar .
sonar serves as submarines ' " eyes . " submarines rely on sonar for voyages , catching targets , and determining attacking elements .
so , sonar servicemen should judge water - surface and underwater targets according to the signals they get through sonar receivers .
during the test , the officers and men discovered that unidentified acoustic waves on the high seas shadowed their submarines for hours . they judged that the signals of the acoustic waves sounded like destroyers , large - sized sea traffic boats , or nuclear submarines .
through tense analyses and judgments , they did not find accurate answers .
at that time , chou yuping , a sonar serviceman at an age of more than 40 years , affirmatively told the commander that the acoustic waves were caused by a flock of whales .
so , the submarines tried to stand still . at last , the whales impatiently swam away .
after the test was over , the tapes recorded with the signals of the acoustic waves were sent to beijing for inspections . chou yuping 's judgments were completely identical with the oceanologists ' .
chou yuping completely relied on his " hearing " to make such outstanding judgments .
acting as a sonar serviceman for 24 years , he has a habit ; that is , he records all kinds of sound he hears .
hearing all kinds of sound he has recorded is the first thing he always does in the morning .
in order to judge two kinds of sound which were very close to the signals of warship propellers , he worked for more than 4 hours and finally told the slight differences between the two signals .
he always puts several tape recorders and earphones out of order in a year due to his hard work .
according to the signals that the sonar receivers get , chou yuping is now able to tell the differences between commercial boats and warships and to tell you how far the targets are , what tonne classes the ships belong to , and how fast the ships are running .
conquering the enemy and winning a victory are submarines ' masterly skills .
to acquire the masterly skills , the officers and men of this detachment have exerted alot of effort .
only two days were left .
on that day , waves were rolling along in succession and the sea was covered with dense fog . but , the practice with live torpedoes was launched as scheduled .
these were questions of whether those exhausted crew might make mistakes and of whether the equipment that had been operating at full capacity for a long period of time might be out of order .
liu guangyou did not care so much but only shared one idea with his comrades - in - arms - - it was worth running risks to enhance the unit 's actual combat capability under such bad conditions .
combat alarms suddenly sounded amid the fog .
two torpedoes were seen flying from the submarines directly toward the " enemy " warships . along with the tremendous noises , dense smoke rolling far away from the submarines gave a signal of victory .
but , training in ordinary times is by no means so easy and satisfactory .
laying mines under deep water is a quite a difficult training course for full - loaded submarines . such a way of mine laying can create higher effects than the previous diving - based mine laying practice .
although such a kind of test was conducted on shore for several times , an unexpected situation took place on the day when the test was conducted on the sea .
at the time of launching torpedoes , the air pressure in the cabins kept on rising suddenly .
the soldiers , though standing beside the commander , could not hear the commander 's orders .
then , the commander used " sign languages " to issue orders , but no desired targets were attained .
the first two underwater tests failed in succession .
failure could not prevent the officers and men from their continuous explorations .
the third test was launched on the sea as scheduled .
the submarines ran submerged deeper and deeper from 10 meters to 20 meters , 30 meters , and so on .
they successfully launched one mine after another and immediately laid dozens of mines in the determined areas , thus establishing an insurmountable mine area under water and indicating that the navy took another leap in its actual combat capability .
besides running submerged , submarines are ready for fighting . they will encounter risks when fighting .
with such a leader , what miracles cannot be created ?
with such an underwater great wall , what worries will the republic have ?
zhu bangzao made these remarks at a regular press conference held here today .
do you have any comment on this ?
zhu bangzao answered : we are seriously concerned about the above report and have lodged solemn and just representations with the united states .
he emphasized that the chinese government and people have consistently and resolutely opposed the united states selling advanced weapons to taiwan .
he pointed out that at present , both sino - us relations and cross - strait relations are in a highly sensitive and crucial period .
china strongly demands the united state scrupulously abide by the three sino - us joint communiques and relevant us commitments , fully understand the serious harm of us arms sales to taiwan , immediately correct its mistake , and stop all arms sales to taiwan .
as they stand in the wto 's doorway , do chinese enterprises have the confidence and ability to participate in international market competition ?
it is the reform and opening up to the outside world after 1978 that has brought china 's household electrical appliance industry a lease of life for major development and made it an emerging industry that is full of vitality .
now china 's household electrical appliance industry is able to manufacture products of more than 100 varieties and of several hundred series of specifications that fit in with the demands of different regions and different strata of the world .
it already ranks first in the world in the output of refrigerators , washing machines , electrical fans , and rice cookers .
the total output value of china 's household electrical appliance industry increased 351 times from 1978 to 1998 , growing from 4.2 billion yuan to 1.4717 trillion yuan , and was projected to touch [ 1.6 trillion ] yuan in 1999 .
the export of chinese household electrical appliances also has showed a rising trend .
how did china 's household electrical appliance industry achieve such rapid , vigorous growth in a matter of just a dozen years ?
the first factor is that china 's reform and opening up to the outside world has created conditions conducive to linking up the chinese household electrical appliance industry with its international counterpart .
the introduction of advanced technology from abroad laid a solid foundation for china 's household electrical appliance industry to get a foothold at home and then march to the world .
the second factor is that market competition has promoted the development and expansion of china 's household electrical appliance industry .
the result was : china 's household electrical appliance industry enhanced its overall standard amid competition , with a number of noted enterprises having made their way through the competition and a number of noted brands finding the market amid competition .
persist in scoring success by quality , implement strategy of internationalized operation the penetration of chinese household electrical appliances into the international market was the result of chinese household electrical appliance enterprises ' implementing a strategy of internationalization and taking the path of internationalization .
in the face of the trends of market and economic globalization , china 's household electrical appliance enterprises became aware that the way for enterprise survival and development lied in taking the path of internationalization .
the process of creating a name brand by the haier group over the past 15 years has been a process of taking the path of internationalization .
however , entry into the international market was not something that could be accomplished in one move .
rely on technological innovation , enhance competitiveness when people asked haier : " what do you rely on to keep a foothold in the international market ? "
haier 's reply was : " we rely on technological innovation . "
to conduct research on technology that is a decade in advance , haier invested 500 million yuan to set up a central research institute and to establish a design company in a joint venture form with foreign partners to bring in internationally first - rate designs .
orientation towards the market and a human - centric approach are starting points in making technological innovations for household electrical appliances as well as key elements of success in opening up the international market .
an upside dewatering washing machine that has a 40 percent share , which continues to show a tendency to expand , of xiaotianer 's annual export volume is a new product developed in line with a widespread demand in the south american market .
a " name brand " was what haier called a " life brand . "
to protect their brands , chinese household electrical appliance enterprises had set about registering their brands abroad during their early days of exporting .
it was exactly this strong brand consciousness that had made it possible for chinese household electrical appliances to establish an international image , have the international market open up wider and wider for them , and remain invincible amid the asian financial crisis . 5 .
strengthen marketing network , extend international market a market is formed through marketing .
chinese household electrical appliance enterprises strengthened their marketing networks and extended their international market in various ways .
as the marketing network strengthens constantly , chinese household electrical appliances ' international market is constantly expanding and sales constantly increasing . haier has projected for its overseas sales to reach at least $ 1 billion by 2006 . 6 .
with its direct bearing on an enterprise 's market prestige and market share , after - sales quality assurance is an even more important factor .
in their general plans for competition , the numerous chinese household electrical appliance enterprises take quality service after sales as a good tool indispensable in competition .
this little move greatly increased its orders . 7 .
adept at judging the hour and assessing the situation , invest in new plants abroad nowadays , the volume of goods produced and delivered to the market in different countries by transnational companies from various countries through their overseas organizations have exceeded the world 's total export volume .
this means the conventional way of domestically producing goods for export is no longer the only practice or even has taken a back seat .
the internationalization strategy implemented by chinese household electrical appliance enterprises has not been limited to exports .
while exporting products , they correctly judged the hour and assessed the situation and set up factories abroad by way of technological exports or joint ventures .
being ahead of the rest , enterprises such as haier , chunlan , xiaotianer , and kelong have not only reduced cost and extended their international markets but have also laid a foundation for further internationalization .
confronted with china 's imminent accession to the wto , chinese household electrical appliance enterprises are speeding up the process of internationalization even further .
" under the general trend of global trade liberalization , there will no longer be a distinction between domestic and international markets . china 's gate will eventually be opened ; other people want to come in , we also want to go out . "
such is the saying of chinese household electrical appliance enterprises .
haier has even set an unequivocal target of making greater efforts to set up factories abroad . it wants to set up common production bases for household electrical appliances in ten of the larger economic regions in the world to make haier a truly " internationalized haier . "
from the experiences in getting chinese household electrical appliances into the international market , we can get a great deal of helpful enlightenment .
the most important one is : we should seek development through competition .
all we can see from the process of chinese household electrical appliances ' march towards the international market is the track of competition .
by daring to participate in international market competition , chinese household electrical appliance enterprises drew a driving force from competition , generated vitality amid competition , gained experience amid competition , and enhanced their quality amid competition .
normalized international market competition all boils down to a competition of strength .
strength comes from high quality , from unceasing technological innovation , and from the market 's approval of name brands .
although various strategies may be employed in forming a marketing network , a high - quality brand is still the most fundamental element .
it would be unimaginable for a product of uncompetitive quality and brand to appear worldwide .
superior quality and technological innovation were precisely what chinese household electrical appliances had relied on to make it into the international market .
the brilliance of the sun can be reflected by a single drop of water .
this droplet is reflecting the spirit and mettle of us , the chinese nation , as well as the courage and resourcefulness of chinese entrepreneurs , all of which have been fully developed and incarnated amid china 's reform and opening up to the outside world .
with the development of economic globalization and the attraction of china 's powerful market , foreign enterprises will integrate with chinese enterprises . under mutually beneficial cooperation , chinese enterprises will enjoy even greater development compared to now .
he said : the legislative law is an important law concerning the state legislative system .
the 12th and 13th meetings of the ninth npc standing committee deliberated over the draft legislative law , and further amended and improved the draft law .
the aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .
in future , the scope of authorized legislation will naturally become smaller as laws become gradually perfect and a more complete legal system gradually takes shape .
on legislative procedures , gu angran said : in line with existing stipulations in our laws , the draft law legalizes and systematizes some basic experiences that have been proven by practice over the years to have manifested the principle of democratic centralism and to be effective .
the draft law also stipulates , in principle , the procedures for formulating administrative and local rules and regulations .
the draft law also makes relevant stipulations on the procedures for proposing , drafting , deliberating , putting to a vote , and promulgating legal interpretations .
gu angran also provided explanations on the applicable areas of the draft legislative law ; applicable rules and regulations ; putting rules and regulations on record ; and other issues .
wang lequan , secretary of the xinjiang uygur autonomous regional cpc committee , said when meeting with reporters : on the work of the large - scale development of the western region , xinjiang must act from a strong sense of duty .
now the central government has included the development of the western region into the overall development plan of the state , and this is just like giving wings to a tiger in xinjiang 's development .
we in xinjiang have taken it seriously and the regional government and concerned units have made decisions on related policies and drafted blueprints for the development .
the development in xinjiang is not only related to the common prosperity of people of various nationalities in xinjiang but is also related to people 's peaceful living and long - term stability in the country 's frontiers .
wang lequan said : people all know that xinjiang has abundant natural resources and beautiful scenery .
however , due to transportation and other reasons , xinjiang 's development has been limited . for instance , the transportation of xinjiang 's petroleum to the eastern region is quite costly .
now the central authorities decided to build a project to deliver xinjiang 's natural gas to shanghai with a total length of 4,200 km .
the project will have immediate and long - range benefits to xinjiang , shanghai and areas along the pipes and will also provide investment opportunities with good prospects for foreign businessmen .
in the course of large - scale development of the western region , xinjiang will fully take advantage of those favorable points and attach importance to intensive processing of products . we will keep benefits in xinjiang and distribute benefits into the hands of people in xinjiang .
xinjiang is a region with people of more different nationalities than other provinces and regions . in addition to uygur and han nationalities , there are people of other nationalities including kazak , mongol , tajik , kirgiz and russian .
wang lequan said : the large - scale development of the western region today still must depend on unity and cooperation of people of various nationalities . without unity , nothing can be done .
the development in the western region must be done within the scope of law from the beginning .
at today 's news briefing held by the foreign ministry , zhu bangzao said mutually granting the most - favored - nation trading status is something normal between countries .
over a long period of time , the united states has conditionally granted most - favored - nation trading status to china , which has to be reexamined each year .
he said that the chinese government persistently holds that the approved permanent normal trade relation status must be smoothly and cleanly granted to china without attaching any conditions .
if this issue cannot be timely and thoroughly resolved , it will greatly damage the interests of us enterprises in china , and will be harmful to the united states in its competition with other members of the world trade organization (wto) for china 's market .
zhu bangzao said that on 15 november last year , china and the united states reached an agreement on china 's accession to wto , and the process of china 's joining wto has been clearly quickened .
the bilateral talks between china and the united states have entered the final stage of conclusion .
the wto principles demand that all its members should unconditionally grant each other most - favored - nation trading status .
however , relevant extant us domestic laws have set up obstacles to granting china the normal trade relation status . this does not conform to the wto principles and is a big obstacle to the development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation between china and the united states .
the spokesman said that the reason china and the united states have been able to reach a bilateral agreement on china 's accession to wto is that the united state has promised to unconditionally grant china most - favored - nation trading status .
if this issue cannot be resolved , the sino - us agreement will lose its foundation for implementation .
that is a situation china does not want to see .
he said that the chinese government appreciated the efforts made by the us government and industrial and commercial circles to promote resolving this issue .
china will try its best to coordinate .
those spoke at the meeting included lu chuanzan and xu leyi , members of the cppcc national committee , and wang zhaolin , sun shoupu , zhang he , chu guangyu , maimaitiming yasheng , xu zhenhu , wang minglong , and rao zuoxun , npc deputies .
after listening to the speeches by npc deputies and members of the cppcc national committees , zhang quanjing , responsible official of the central joint conference on " three stresses " education , spoke at the meeting .
he said : since the publishing of the important speech made by comrade jiang zemin in gaozhou city , guangdong , it has evoked strong repercussions across the country , and an upsurge of studying the speech has been rapidly started .
guided by the spirit of this speech , people in various localities have been extensively conducting the " three stresses " education and making vigorous efforts to perform their work .
zhang quanjing pointed out : conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level is the most important task of this year 's party building .
party committees at all levels should further enhance their understanding , step up their efforts at work , and effectively strengthen their leadership .
following the example set by central leading comrades , responsible officials of party committees ( at the prefectural level ) should take up matters personally and strengthen their supervision , inspection , and guidance .
zhang quanjing said : the party central committee attaches great importance to the conduct of the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , and large numbers of cadres and the masses place high hopes on it .
wang xudong and bai keming , members of the central joint conference on " three stresses " education , took part in the informal meeting .
china 's wto entry is just around the corner , so which laws and rules should be readjusted and perfected first ?
a number of deputies and members attending the " two sessions " in beijing have explored this question .
long yongtu , vice minister of the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said at a national people 's congress [ npc ] panel discussion that the departments concerned are now amending or abolishing rules that conflict with the wto .
this is extremely complex work , because there are over 900 relevant laws and rules throughout the country , and examining and amending them item by item is by no means an easy task .
for instance , when foreign companies invested in china in the past , there may have been provisions in the agreement provisions that these companies must transfer technology , or else on restricting the sales in china of the products of foreign - funded enterprises .
after china joins the wto , most of these restrictions must be abolished , and the relevant regulations must be amended or abolished to avoid future conflict .
gao shangquan proposed six countermeasures to deal with these challenges .
these are mainly to be carried out through strategic economic readjustment , speeding up structural reforms , and further perfecting the rule of law basis of market economy .
in the various readjustments and reforms , it is necessary to amend the existing laws and rules , and at the same time formulate numerous new laws and rules suited to market economy and globalized economy .
they also proposed in their motion that legislation be adopted as soon as possible to ensure through the form of law the credit reliability of public information .
in this way china will gain an international reputation after wto entry .
he pointed out that china opened up its rmb current account in 1994 , but continues to strictly control the capital account , and officials say there is no timetable for the rmb 's free convertibility .
china 's wto entry , however , is a rare opportunity , and china 's ties with the international market will become still closer .
china 's wto entry means that the rules of the game are changed and that we must switch from formulating our own rules to adapting to the rules formulated by countries around the world .
many of our enterprises understand very little of these rules and conventions and are hardly familiar with them at all .
but if we do not understand these rules , we will come off worst in future market competition and exchange and cooperation , and this requires a long process of study on our part .
at the same time , the problem of being unadapted and unaccustomed to many of the rules requires that we gradually change our old behavior standards .
this is because in the past we were accustomed to government intervention and even to monopoly operations , but an important provision of the international market rules is to stress transparency and fairness .
hence , china 's enterprises should step up their study of international market rules and arm themselves with this set of rules to meet the challenge of foreign enterprises .
he also said that the boy designated by the dalai as the " reincarnated soul boy " of the panchen is doing very well [ sheng huo de hen hao 3932 3172 1779 1771 1170 ] .
to accelerate army modernization , the key lies in grasping the major events bearing on the overall situation and having eyes on the major strategic issues that are related to direction .
to promote army modernization , the motivation lies in reform , and the outlet also lies in reform .
the education on ideals and convictions and the education on army 's historical mission and fundamental functions should be intensified to further incorporate the energy , will , intelligence , and wisdom of all military officers and soldiers to army modernization .
the pla delegation held its second plenary meeting this afternoon .
chairman jiang delivered an important speech after conscientiously listening to the opinions of deputies .
he first of all fully affirmed the achievements scored in army building last year .
he said : last year the armed forces and the people 's armed police forces withstood the trials from three major political struggles and made new progress in comprehensive construction .
now we can declare to the whole world that the great task of reducing the size of the pla by 500,000 , set forth by the 15th cpc congress , was fulfilled at the end of last year .
this indicates that our army has taken a great step toward the objectives of " streamlining , combination , and efficiency . "
meanwhile , remarkable results were achieved in the " three - stress " education , and the coherence and combat capacity of party committees at all levels were strengthened as well .
the upsurge of mass scientific and technological training was set off across the pla units , and joint military exercises of all services and arms of nanjing and guangzhou theaters were thoroughly organized and conducted .
major headway was made in building national defense - oriented science and technology as well as armaments , and a long - range surface - to - surface missile and the experimental spacecraft " shenzhou " were successful launched .
the socialization of logistics support and other reform items were promoted positively , and all the preparations for kicking off the joint service system were completed on schedule .
the grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of new china demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization . this military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .
the macao troops were smoothly stationed in macao to perform their defense duties , and they were warmly received by macao compatriots .
chairman jiang pointed out : this year is at the turn of the century .
all armed forces should clearly understand their historical mission and continue to comprehensively push army building to the new century with a new outlook .
chairman jiang indicated : peace and development remain the two major themes in today 's world .
the trends of political multi - polarization and economic globalization continue to develop , science and technology progress with each passing day , and the international situation tends to ease up in general .
however , the international forces are seriously out of balance , old and unreasonable international political and economic order has not thoroughly changed , and hegemony and power politics have developed anew .
so we should have a strong sense of suffering .
without a solid national defense , there is no strong army , and it is impossible for us to wholeheartedly engage in economic construction .
all pla officers and men should firmly embrace the concept of preparedness against war and constantly enhance the army 's deterrent capacity and actual combat capacity .
the stronger our national defense strength is , a greater guarantee will be given to our country 's security and to the fulfillment of the great cause .
chairman jiang pointed out : keeping the society and politics stable constitutes the necessary precondition for economic and social development .
these years , we have always paid attention to correctly handling the relations between reform , development , and stability ; and social and political situation has been kept stable in general .
however , we should clearly notice that various unstable factors remain .
so the army should vigorously support local party committees and governments to maintain social and political stability in strict accordance with the spirit of the directions of the cpc central committee .
chairman jiang indicated : the army should successfully perform its fundamental function of safeguarding state sovereignty and security and should , at the same time , actively participate in and support the economic construction of the state .
this is an important thinking of comrades mao zedong and deng xiaoping .
since the commencement of reform and opening up , our army has consistently subordinate itself to and facilitate the overall task of economic construction and has vigorously helped localities develop the economy , thus making great contributions in this aspect .
given the new situation , the army should continue to carry forward its fine tradition and make new contributions to the economic construction of the state .
the central authorities set forth the strategy of extensively develop western regions with a view to accelerating the development of these regions . this is a major strategic policy decision related to the overall situation of china 's modernization drive .
actively participating in and supporting the extensive development of western regions constitutes the army 's actual action to subordinate itself to and facilitate the overall task of economic construction .
the central military commission is about to put forward an overall plan for supporting the extensive development of western regions after soliciting the opinions of various pla general departments .
the armed forces should energetically explore new forms and new ways to participate in and support the development of western regions under the condition of developing socialist market economy by making better use of their advantages .
referring to the issues of further intensifying the modernization of national defense and the army , chairman jiang emphasized : the modernization of national defense and the army has witnessed noticeable achievements along with the advances in reform , opening up , and modernization drive .
he said : to quicken the modernization of our army , we need to do a lot of things .
the modernization of our army is a systems engineering project . all levels of party committees and leading cadres should have a firm grip on the overall situation and pay attention to thinking of and handling issues from an overall perspective .
chairman jiang stressed : to push forward the modernization of the army , the motivation lies in reform , and the outlet lies in reform as well .
without a pioneering courage and a reform spirit , it is hard to make breakthroughs and accomplish something .
military , political , logistics , and armament work should all be actively and appropriately reformed with a view to enhancing the army 's combat capacity .
for the reforms conducted in the past , we should earnestly summarize experiences ; and for the new reform items , we should conduct sufficient appraisals for them and carry them out one by one whenever they are proven mature .
we should continue to emancipate the mind , proceed from reality , and stress actual results when doing a thing . we should positively and actively resolve contradictions and problems and strive to probe into the characteristics and laws of army administration during the new period .
chairman jiang emphasized that all armed forces should go further to truly implement all items of work .
he said : the direction of army construction and reform for the foreseeable future has already been defined , major policies and principles have been decided , and a unified understanding has already been provided for the major issues related to the overall situation .
what counts is realistic implementation . now , unrealistic styles of leadership and work still exist .
the problems of this kind that were ferreted out during the current " three - stress " campaign should be resolved in a resolute way .
chairman jiang emphasized : first of all , we should have the determination and enthusiasm to grasp implementation and stay high - spirited .
these years , the central military commission and various pla general departments have taken a series of important measures in choosing , training , educating , and managing senior cadres , thus greatly strengthening the ranks of senior cadres .
however , it should be noted frankly that the current situation in our army 's ranks of senior cadres still lags behind the requirements of the new situation and new tasks , and some problems in these ranks still warrant our attention .
failing to resolve these problems , senior cadres will be unable to shoulder important tasks and will affect and even hinder the causes of the party and the people .
upon hearing the opinions of the delegates on the work of the npc standing committee , li peng stressed the need that the legislation work should persistently follow the mass line and withstand tests in practice .
they believed that the work report was practical , brief and to the point , and full of novelty ; and that it has provided explicit solutions to specific problems .
as npc deputies , they expressed satisfaction with the work of the npc standing committee over the past year .
at the meeting , the delegates said that they were all inspired by the report ; and at the same time , they also brought forward some ideas and suggestions on the npc work in the future .
the delegates suggested that a thoroughgoing and sustained education on socialist democracy and legal system , especially propaganda and education directed against specific problems , should be carried out for the purpose of enhancing the legal awareness of the masses of the people and the vast numbers of cadres .
it is of particular importance to study and propagate the constitution , which is a body of basic laws ; and this is a task which we need to carry on persistently for a long period of time in the future .
li peng pointed out : building socialism with chinese characteristics is a brand - new undertaking ; therefore , the npc also needs to display a pioneering spirit when promoting its legislation and supervision work .
the formulation of laws should be based on a summarization of the practical experiences of the masses of the people , persistently follow the principle of " from the practice , to the practice , " and withstand the tests of the practice .
the more we develop our economy , the more we need to strengthen our legal building . this is a need of our economic development , a need of the people in their daily life , and a need of our efforts to build up a sound investment environment .
we should give a better play to the roles of people 's congress and its deputies at all levels ; and this is a need for building up socialism with chinese characteristics , and a need for strengthening democracy and the legal system , stressed li peng .
coming from all walks of life , the deputies of the people 's congress in our country can fully reflect the popular will of the people in society , and can represent the interests of the people .
by bringing into full play the roles of people 's congress deputies in the legislation and supervision work , we can enrich the work connotation of the people 's congress .
therefore , we should attach great importance to the opinions and suggestions forwarded by the deputies of the people 's congress , and take earnest steps to find proper solutions to relevant problems .
in view of this , we ought to strengthen our future legislation work in combination with the anti - corruption struggle .
the 17th karmapa left for india at the end of last year .
raidi rebuked foreign media reports on the arrest of the karmapa 's parents and the lamas of the monastery as " groundless and harboring ulterior motives . "
a xinhua correspondent asked : " how does chongqing consider its position in the project of extensively developing western regions ? "
he guoqiang , secretary of the chongqing municipal party committee , answered : chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region . the chang jiang golden waterways have linked chongqing to both eastern and western regions .
thus , chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other . development of western regions is a long - term strategy as well as the overall task of the country .
to this end , chongqing is accelerating the infrastructure construction with communications projects as the mainstay , is vigorously improving the ecological environment , and is planning for the future based on the present .
first , we will strengthen the cooperation with sichuan province .
thus far , chongqing 's territory in the three gorges reservoir areas has already relocated 130,000 people and has been well prepared for relocating an additional 100,000 people in the next step .
as of 2003 when the first generating unit goes into operation , a total of 500,000 people need to be relocated . now , we are actively creating conditions for attaining this goal , and the targets for each year have already been defined .
through endeavor , this goal will be attained smoothly . we are resolute and strict in investigating and punishing those who violate laws and discipline in managing the funds earmarked for relocating residents .
last year , we openly tried the wanzhou and fengdu corruption cases and sentenced principal criminals to life imprisonment and to death respectively .
from now on , we will go further to intensify prevention , supervision , examination , investigation , and punishment to such cases .
so far , we have rectified and corrected 80 percent of the revealed cases concerning the occupation and diversion of the funds earmarked for relocating residents .
thus , chongqing municipality will enhance efforts to conduct enterprise reform , guarantee the basic livelihood of the workers laid off by state - owned enterprises , and vigorously promote the reemployment project .
recently , the central financial authorities increased the transfer allocations to chongqing , 40 percent of which have already been specially used to ensure the livelihood of laid - off workers .
along with the deepening and perfection of reform , the situation has begun to improve . in addition , with the development opportunity brought about by the strategy of the extensive development of western regions , all these problems will be resolved in a short period of time .
according to the arrangements of the central authorities , chongqing has already begun the experimental projects of protecting natural forests , reversing farmlands to forests and pasturelands , and afforesting barren hills .
henan deputy xiao hong [ 5135 4767 ] said : the npc standing committee has made new headway in legislation this year and has played a positive role in ensuring the smooth progress of china 's reform and opening up .
in particular , the standing committee has provided a powerful legal guarantee for the healthy development of our social and economic development by closely combining legislation with major decisions in china 's reform , development , and stability .
the present session will be discussing the draft legislation law . this piece of legislation will play an important role in standardizing legislative work .
the standing committee also assigned great importance to the motions tabled by deputies and to the handling of their proposals , criticisms , and suggestions , and ensured that the motions and proposals put forward by deputies were put into effect .
hunan deputy wang keying [ 3769 0344 5391 ] said : in developing socialist democratic politics , it is necessary to proceed from china 's actual conditions and uphold the party 's leadership . on no account should we mechanically copy western democratic models .
the broad masses of the people pin their hopes on the supervisory work of the npc and urge the npc to intensify its supervision .
the npc 's supervision of the state council , the supreme people 's court , and the supreme people 's procuratorate is in fact its way of supporting their work .
in future , the npc must assign greater importance to its work of supervision , talk about supervision with great confidence , and grasp supervision in a down - to - earth manner .
it must combine general supervision with procedural supervision , combine supervision of things with supervision of people , and promote administration according to the law and judicial justice .
on the future work of the standing committee , many deputies believed that in accordance with the requirement of building a socialist legal system with chinese characteristics , the primary task of the npc should be to do legislative work well .
one of the reasons for the spread of corruption in society is the lack of supervision and constraint over power .
at present , special efforts should be made to strengthen supervision over judicial organs and supervise and support judicial organs in handling cases according to law and ensuring judicial justice .
guangxi deputy zhao fulin [ 6392 1381 2651 ] said : many of the provisions of the constitution and of laws and regulations have to be implemented by administrative organs .
in future , the npc and its standing committee should continue to conduct propaganda and education on socialist democracy and the legal system in a thorough and sustained way in order to enhance the legal awareness and legal concept of the whole nation .
government functionaries , particularly leading cadres , must exert to study laws and regulations and improve their ability to act in accordance with law .
in the meantime , they also reviewed the government work report together with the deputies .
jiang chunyun said : since the introduction of reform and opening up , china has made remarkable achievements in legislation , but there are still such problems as legislation rights being inexplicit , legislation procedures being unstandardized , and legislation quality being low .
it is very important and imperative to formulate a law on lawmaking so as to standardize and systematize the formulation of laws , regulations , and rules .
jiang chunyun raised six proposals on further improving the quality and efficiency of legislation . first , legislation should be based on the constitution , to safeguard the uniformity and prestige of the country 's legal system .
second , legislation should focus on the central task of the party and the state and cater to the overall interests of reform , development , and stability .
third , legislation should give full expression to democracy and abide by the mass line .
fourth , legislation should proceed strictly according to the legally prescribed rights and procedures .
fifth , the legislators contingent should be further strengthened and a high - quality contingent of legislation cadres should be fostered .
sixth , strengthening party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for making a success of legislation .
there is a need to upgrade the party 's proposals to state ideas through legal procedures , and to ensure the implementation of the party 's line , principles , and policies by means of law , rules , and regulations .
zou jiahua stresses importance of protecting environment when joining the anhui delegation 's discussion today , npc vice chairman zou jiahua pointed out the need for the entire society to strengthen its awareness about environmental protection to improve environmental protection .
zou jiahua pointed out : large , medium - sized , small , and mini urban sewage water treatment plants should be built coordinately . ideas should be worked on the sizes of equipment and its rational distribution , to save construction and operational costs .
now sewage treatment departments in localities are undertakings with a heavy financial burden ; these can be changed to enterprises that can turn sewage water into a product for the market , to gain economic benefit .
the mud and sludge gas left over from sewage treatment can also be turned into products for the market .
sewage water treatment can be considered as an industry so that sewage water treatment will be industrialized and socialized .
wang guangying urges all levels of people 's congresses to improve work when joining the tianjin delegation discussion , npc vice chairman wang guangying said : in the past year , the npc standing committee has done lots of fruitful work .
legislation has proceeded in close coordination with the state 's major policy of carrying out reform , promoting development , and maintaining stability , thereby ensuring and stimulating the development of all undertakings .
supervision has been augmented over the state 's major issues and hot points the masses are concerned about .
it is necessary to popularize the education on law among the masses to strengthen the mentality about law .
all levels of cadres should take the lead in studying and observing law and in carrying out administration according to law .
buhe stressed the need to strengthen the propagation on the legal system and mobilize people in the entire society to extensively , profoundly , and protractedly propagate the legal system by all means .
he added : with a good job in the education on law , all kinds of work will further improve .
in addition , we should further strengthen political and ideological education in rural areas .
we have much good experience and practice in ideological education ; this experience and practice should be summarized and popularized .
buhe said that as long as spiritual civilization is further strengthened along with the strengthening of ideological and political work as well as the propagation on the legal system , we will certainly develop faster and better .
to achieve the target of this education , we must further improve the compulsory education fund investment mechanism , strengthen the government 's responsibility , and ensure the prompt issuance of education funds and salaries for teachers in poor areas .
since its establishment , the people 's congress system has achieved remarkable results , thus displaying the superiority of this system .
the nature , position , and role of the people 's congress has been gradually understood by more and more people .
zhou guangzhao says equal stressed should be laid on science and education to turn the burden of " population " into wealth npc vice chairman zhou guangzhao joined the hunan delegation 's discussion .
zhou guangzhao said : the crucial point for china , which is advancing toward the new century , to seize the new round of development opportunity is science and education .
we should pay attention to " improving the people 's quality " - - which is a basic project .
cao zhi said : in performing the work of the people 's congress , we should uphold cpc leadership and guarantee that the party will always play a role in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all aspects .
cao zhi stressed the need to profoundly conduct education on popularization of law .
he pointed out that it is necessary to carry out propagation and education on the democratic legal system in various forms , to improve the people 's awareness about law and the legal system , so that the masses will study , observe , and apply law better .
cheng siwei stressed need to strengthen people 's congress legislation and supervision when taking part in the guangdong delegation 's discussion , npc vice chairman cheng siwei indicated the need for the people 's congress to continue to strengthen its legislative and supervisory work .
he pointed that china should uphold the systematization , progressiveness , uprightness , and scientific nature of legislative work , to establish a socialist legal system suited to china 's national conditions .
he also pointed out : people 's congress supervision is a very important job . without the power to supervise , corruption will crop up ; without supervision over the power , everything will only remain formalism .
to do a good job in supervisory work , people 's congress deputies should first be brave in executing the duties entrusted by the constitution , earnestly do something for the masses , and carry out the supervisory power according to law .
on the other hand , good supervisory work is inseparable from the leadership and support of the party .
only by combining people 's congress deputies ' implementation of duties with the party 's support for deputies , can the people 's congress guarantee the effective implementation of its supervisory work .
xu jialu said : supervision is an eternal subject , and at no time can we say that supervision is adequate .
effective measures should be taken so that supervision can yield actual results .
he hoped that all levels of governments , particularly leading cadres , will conscientiously study law and popularize legal knowledge .
jiang zhenghua said : the responsibility of the ninth npc is to build a legal framework under market economic conditions and keep improving it . there are mainly six laws : constitutional law , criminal law , and civil law , which includes commercial law .
the other three are procedural laws , namely , criminal procedural law , civil procedural law , and administrative procedural law .
procedural laws and substantive laws are closely linked to each other .
only by strictly implementing procedural laws , can substantive laws display their role .
the promulgation of these six laws marked the basic formation of the legal framework in china .
china 's reforms , opening up , and modernization continued to forge ahead in all - round fashion in 1999 amid a complex internal and external environment ; new achievements were scored on all fronts , and the predicted work targets were attained .
the general situation is good , and is better than expected in some respects .
the major central guidelines on reform and development have been clearly set out , a number of important state laws and regulations have been promulgated , and the state council has made specific arrangements for this year 's government work .
in order to truly implement all this and achieve our targets , we must devote tremendous efforts , and a key point is to be strict in managing government affairs and to work hard in comprehensively strengthening management .
management is an old topic , but it still requires great and particular stress .
this is because china is still far from resolving the problem of management .
the management i am speaking of here includes strengthening supervision and straightening things out .
not only must the enterprises strengthen management ; industry , agriculture , finance and taxation , financial institutions , trade , science and technology , education , culture , and public health must also strengthen management .
government organs must still more give prominence to strengthening management , further change their functions , transform their work methods and style , and greatly enhance their standard of service and work efficiency .
comprehensively strengthening management is an urgent task at present .
we must further realize that after china joins the world trade organization , our opening to the world will enter a new stage , and we will be facing ever more intense international competition ; this is both a fine opportunity and also a severe challenge .
if we fail to set high standards and strict demands in management , it will be hard to enhance china 's economic competitiveness and ability to resist risks .
hence , whether in seriously implementing the guidelines , policies , and measures laid down or adapting to the demands of developments , we must have the sense of urgency to vigorously grasp management , and achieve marked results as soon as possible .
first of all , we must properly strengthen the scientific management of the enterprises .
there is no light and handy path to follow in reforming and developing china 's state enterprises , and we must honestly improve and strengthen their operational management and establish a set of modern enterprise systems .
otherwise , we can hardly meet the demands of market economy .
the state enterprises must turn their vision inward and be strict in managing their affairs , centering around building modern enterprise systems and achieving the target of reform and extrication from difficulty .
the focus in strengthening the scientific management of the enterprises must be on grasping various management aspects centered on management of finances and production costs and quality control .
while promoting the separation of government from enterprises , we must get a good grasp of assigning work to the supervisory boards and chief accountants of the large and medium - sized enterprises , and tangibly strengthen the supervision and control of the state enterprises .
we must further rectify the enterprise leadership groups , and in particular select young cadres with ability and political integrity to augment the enterprise leadership groups .
the cause of the major accidents that occurred in the previous period lay in lack of strict management .
hence , it is essential to attach great importance to management of production safety and tangibly strengthen it , and eliminate in good time the hidden dangers that can cause accidents .
second , we must give prominence to grasping financial and economic management and strictly enforce fiscal , taxation , and financial discipline .
strict management and supervision is extremely important in banking , securities , and insurance , and it is essential to enhance the external and internal supervision and control of the financial institutions .
we must vigorously straighten out social credit , and strictly enforce discipline in settling accounts .
we must seriously take stock of and straighten out social intermediary institutions such as those handling economic authentication , and properly resolve conspicuous problems of " chaotic operations , management , and enforcement . "
the departments concerned have already made arrangements for this work and they must grasp it tightly and do it really well .
in masking a success of management in these respects , we should give further play to the supervisory role of the administrative control and auditing departments .
third , further straighten out and regulate order in the circulation and construction centers and intensify market supervision and control .
at present violations of law of various kinds are still quite serious in china 's circulation field , and some continue despite repeated prohibition ; these seriously affect and interfere with the normal development and operation of socialist market economy .
hence , we must severely and ruthlessly crack down , according to law , on the manufacture and sale of counterfeit , fake , and inferior goods , smuggling and peddling of contraband , and other illegal commercial swindles .
at the same time , we must resolutely put a stop to various kinds of local protectionism and abnormal competition practice such as carving up or blockading markets , and ensure normal market order with fair competition , to promote the establishment of a unified market throughout the country .
at present there are rather serious problems in the construction sector , and it imperative to devote great efforts to straightening them out .
we must achieve marked results in straightening out the construction market this year .
we must strengthen the all - round and all - process supervision and control of construction projects so as to ensure their quality .
construction , survey , design , building , and project supervisory units must take responsibility for project quality ; those who violate project quality regulations must be resolutely punished according to law .
in devoting great efforts to comprehensively strengthening management , it is essential to straighten out rules and establish systems , cure both the symptoms and the cause , and establish and put on a sound basis strict responsibility systems .
if people do not comply with the rules or have no set blueprints , it is essential to ensure that there are rules to follow , that they are followed , and that violators are held accountable .
only thus can all aspects of management be firmly implemented .
the most important thing in strengthening management is to work in the spirit of being highly responsible to the party and the people , and be bold in sticking to principles and tackling tough problems .
otherwise , strengthening management will turn out to be just empty talk .
comrade jiang zemin emphasized at the fourth plenary session of the central commission for discipline inspection : " in governing the party it is first necessary to govern the party , and the party must be governed in strict fashion . "
we must seriously implement the spirit of comrade jiang zemin 's important speech , grasp stepping up the building of honest government and struggling against corruption as an important content of being strict in managing government affairs , and promote the all - round strengthening and deepening of management .
strengthening the building of honest government and punishing corruption are related to the rise or fall of the state .
the government must be honest , hardworking , pragmatic , and efficient , and it must put honesty in first place .
it must first be honest , and then hardworking ; without these two attributes , it fundamentally does a disservice to the people .
it cannot be hardworking , pragmatic , or efficient unless it is honest .
this year we must intensify our work , fully implement the " principles of honest government , " and continue to carry out the " simple rules to be observed by all concerned " and the " five demands . "
ours is the people 's government , and the fundamental duty of the people 's government is to wholeheartedly serve the people , and exercising honest administration is the most elementary demand .
there is an old saying that rulers must be upright .
the government organs at all levels and all their work personnel must succeed in being upright and honest , scrupulously carry out their duties , and not disappoint the people 's earnest expectations .
it is also essential to start with strict management in opposing corruption and promoting honesty .
an important reason why corruption continues despite repeated prohibition is that certain departments and units fail to educate , manage , and supervise the cadres .
it is essential to further deepen the reform of the administrative and management system , intensify the supervision and constraint mechanism , strictly carry out the laws and regulations and systems , and prevent and cure corruption right from its beginnings .
xiao yang added that this effort has promoted mainland china 's contacts and cooperation in the judicial sector with hong kong and macao and gained experiences in strengthening judicial cooperation between different territorial legal units in the same country .
however , when they arrived at the great hall of the people today as the first group , they lined up and entered the hall in perfect order , instead of in a relatively scattered manner just like they did in the past .
however , chen xianhua and jin renxie , commander of the tianjin garrison district , were still blocked by reporters .
being asked by reporters time and again , they answered questions in an unhurried and well - ordered manner .
these two deputies pointed out that the united states ' arms sales to taiwan have run counter to the stipulations of the three sino - us communiques and damaged the unification of china .
when asked what kind of situation will occur if the united states gets involved in the mainland - taiwan war , they said in one voice that china has confidence .
this npc deputy from the pla proposes that the npc should draw up as soon as possible the " national defense mobilization law " and the " war mobilization law " to provide legal stipulations for the overall requirements and the overall issues concerning the national defense mobilization .
he added : air attack constitutes the major operation form of wars under the high - tech condition .
for this reason , we should accelerate the building of urban air defense system , make good urban planning , and strive to combine the peacetime needs with the wartime preparedness .
we should also realize the scattered distribution of key targets and the covered distribution of key projects and build well the urban people 's air defense system .
strongly emphasizing ideological and political work is our party 's excellent tradition and political advantage .
because of the exposure of the problem of " falungong , " we more clearly understand that it is of utmost importance and urgency to strengthen the party s ideological and political work in the new period .
facts prove that if marxism and proletarian thoughts do not occupy the field of ideology , various non - marxist and non - proletarian thoughts , and even anti - marxist thoughts , will occupy it .
in our ideological and cultural work , we promote letting a hundred schools of thought contend . however , the goal of letting a hundred schools of thought contend is meant to develop marxism and socialist thoughts and cultures .
we should study these problems one by one , work out measures and strive to solve them .
we must criticize and correct wrong viewpoints running against the focus of economic construction , against the policy of reform and opening up and against the four basic principles . we must take a clear - cut stand and distinguish right from wrong .
in all of our propaganda and cultural work , we must persist in the principle of benefiting the construction of material and spiritual civilization and the improvement of the people 's spiritual , cultural and living standards .
when strengthening and improving our ideological and political work , we should put our emphasis on the grassroots .
we must conscientiously investigate and study various social developments as well as the new situations and changes in the masses ' spiritual development . we must target the masses ' real problems and do well our work of ideological education and guidance .
our work will not be effective if we shout slogans hollowly , only touch upon our work without going into it deeply or being cursory .
the content of our ideological and political work must be close to the masses . we must be good at starting with problems which are closest to the masses ' interests and the masses care about the most . we must satisfy the masses in our work .
this is an important starting point in the work of strengthening the party 's ideological and political work .
when we develop the socialist market economy and build socialism with chinese characteristics , in addition to establishing a socialist legal system suitable for them , we must form a society - wide socialist ideological and moral system suitable for them .
laws restrain us while we restrain ourselves with morality .
what we are developing is a socialist market economy , so we must form a moral standard for the socialist market .
strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work in the new situation is an important task of the entire party and the most important issue among important issues in the work of promoting ideology .
first , it is necessary to persist in two opening ups .
to speed up the development of the western region , the government should implement a more preferential policy toward foreign investment than that practiced in the eastern region in order to attract more foreign capital .
meanwhile , great importance should also be attached to attracting investment from the eastern region .
second , the role of the government and the market should be brought into play .
in terms of development project , investment pattern , enterprise organization , business management , goods production , and sales service , it is necessary to act according to the market law and compete under the principle of being just , fair , and open .
the development of the western region is a great strategic plan , in which the government plays a very important role .
experience gained in the united states and other countries has proven that in developing backward regions , government support in terms of planning , coordination , policy , and funding is quite indispensable .
third , it is necessary not only to accelerate speed but , more importantly , to improve quality .
in developing the western region , we should not concentrate on development speed alone , but should integrate development speed with quality improvement .
fourth , nonpublic economy should be developed .
fifth , close attention should be paid to protecting the environment and resources .
sixth , infrastructure construction , such as communications and transportation , communication network , and water and electricity supply , should be speeded up .
seventh , educational and scientific undertakings should be developed .
eighth , it is necessary to exchange resources for capital .
as the western region is rich in resources , an important option is to exchange resources for capital and technology .
ninth , financial support for the development of the western region should be intensified .
tenth , construction of small cities and towns should be speeded up .
li peng , chairman of the standing committee of the national people 's congress [ npc ] this morning [ 10 march ] made a report on the work of the npc standing committee at the third session of the ninth npc .
in the past , the report on the work of the npc standing committee was always made by a vice chairman of the npc standing committee .
making a report on the work of the npc standing committee by the chairman himself is the first time in the history of china 's npc .
observers in beijing held that there are three reasons as follows : first , making the report by the chairman has reflected the acceptance of suggestions by npc deputies .
npc deputies have commented favorably on the work of npc during the past two years and suggested that chairman li peng personally make a report .
this is their affirmation of the work of the ninth npc over the past two years .
second , making the work report by the chairman in person shows that he attaches importance to the work of the npc .
a number of npc deputies said that the premier in person makes the report on the work of the government and so the report on the work of the npc standing committee should also be made by the chairman of the npc standing committee .
the ninth npc has achieved good results in its work over the past two years , and so it is quite natural that the chairman should personally make a report .
compared with last year 's report on " continuing to strengthen legislative work , raising the quality of legislation and striving to fulfill legislative tasks , " this year 's report has stressed " achieving breakthroughs in the area of tackling legislative difficulties . "
the work of " achieving breakthroughs in difficult legislative work " now has a solid foundation .
during 1999 , " important achievements " were made in legislative work , and thus " making another stride in initially forming a socialist legal system with chinese characteristics within the current legislative term . "
the goal of " achieving breakthroughs in legislative work " is to compile a relatively complete civil code . if the work can be accomplished within this term of the npc , it will be a major breakthrough in npc 's legislative work .
the supervision work of the ninth npc is characterized by its clear planning , early arrangements , breakthroughs in key issues , concrete measures , and solid efforts to make progress despite difficulties .
in the current report , chairman li peng stressed the need to forbid formalism in supervision work .
compared with last year 's report , li peng emphasized that in making investigations , it is necessary to arrive without pomp and go down to the grassroots level .
this demand shows the chairman has paid attention to reducing the burden of governments at various levels in receiving supervision personnel and , what is more important , only in this way the role of supervision can be fully developed .
in his report , in addition to stressing " legislative work " and " supervision , " chairman li peng has also attached great importance to promoting exchanges with foreign parliaments and giving full play to the role of deputies from hong kong and macao .
in his report , chairman li peng has mentioned " dialogs " and " struggles " in npc 's foreign affairs work last year .
as to npc 's " exchanges and cooperation with parliaments of other countries and international organizations " in the future , chairman li peng noted the need to " further create a new situation . "
the part in dealing with foreign affairs in the report has explained that npc will take the initiative to further develop its role in the foreign affairs arena .
the report holds that npc deputies from hong kong and macao can play a dual role .
the report has pointed out : " since the return of hong kong to the motherland , the npc deputies from hong kong special administrative region have been very enthusiastic in taking part in managing state affairs and they have conscientiously carried out their duties .
the npc deputies from macao special administrative region have also organized an independent group to take part in managing state affairs in the current session .
chinese minister of information industry wu jichuan said : china must facilitate price restructuring in its telecommunications sector . first of all , we will separate the accounts on charges for domestic and international operations .
wu jichuan said : at present , we are evaluating and approving the " regulations governing the telecommunications industry " which includes internet operations .
commenting on telecommunications charges , he said : the state determines telecommunications charges . in view of the current situation , we should structurally readjust telecommunications charges .
he said : at present , china maintains unified accounts on charges for domestic and international operations . to attain international standards , we should , first of all , separate the accounts on charges for domestic and international operations .
he pointed out that hong kong 's economic development has been quite healthy . he also said , " your god of finance ( donald tsang yam - kuen ) has done his work very well . quite good .
he is very capable . "
he also said smilingly he had to learn from him .
how do npc deputies from hong kong take an active part in the management of state affairs and exercise their functions in line with the principle of " one country , two systems " ?
at the recent npc session , an explicit definition has been given to this issue .
as it is known to all , " one country , two systems " is a complete concept .
we should first uphold " one country " ; in other words , we must ensure a unified state sovereignty and tolerate no separatism .
the autonomy of a high degree is endowed to a special administrative region by the central government through the basic law .
the central government will not interfere in the affairs that fall within the jurisdiction of the high - degree autonomy of special administrative regions , neither can special administrative regions interfere in the socialist system practiced in china 's inland areas .
the hong kong basic law is a national law , which should be observed not only by hong kong but by the entire country as well .
both hong kong and china 's inland areas have the responsibility to implement the concept of " one country , two systems . "
hong kong should do its part to defend the socialist system practiced in the country 's inland areas , and refrain from doing anything that may undermine china 's state sovereignty and territorial integrity or may impair the country 's socialist system .
neither will inland areas interfere in the affairs of the hong kong special administrative region [ sar ] .
when hong kong npc deputies are attending npc sessions and are exercising functions as npc deputies , they are participating in the management of the state affairs of the socialist country .
when they are residing in hong kong between sessions , they are the citizens of the hong kong sar , and will enjoy the same rights as those enjoyed by hong kong residents .
the central government should support his work , all departments under the hong kong sar government should support his work , and hong kong people from all walks of life should also support his work .
a special administrative region needs a leader in its implementation of the basic law , and this leader is the chief executive .
people from all circles in hong kong should defend the authority of the chief executive , rally around the chief executive , and ensure a sound administration in the hong kong sar in line with the basic law .
so long as all of us can work with one heart and one mind , hong kong 's affairs can surely be handled satisfactorily .
environmental protection is incorporated in the state plan and has become part and parcel of the state plan , which has been carried out in various trades and localities throughout the country and has provided a broad market space for the development of environmental protection enterprises .
by the end of 1997 , there were 7,617 environmental protection enterprises in china , with the total fixed assets amounting to 62.09 billion yuan . they have formed a pattern under which the state - owned enterprises are developing alongside the township collective enterprises and private enterprises .
there is an inseparable link between the development of china 's environmental protection sector and the development of the world environmental protection markets .
at present , the countries that hold a dominant position in the international markets of environmental protection industries are mainly the united states , germany , and japan .
cologne in germany has only a population of half a million people , but its output value of environmental protection has reached 45 billion mark .
in 1993 , the volume of trade in the world environmental protection markets was $ 356 billion , and by 2000 , it will rise to $ 600 billion , which is a very huge market space .
international environmental protection enterprises make access to china the continuous access of international environmental protection enterprises to china will bring along equipment with high technological contents and fine quality , which is of positive significance to enhancing the overall level of china 's environmental protection sector .
the foreign environmental protection enterprises introduced the mechanism of competition a relatively long time ago , took the market as an orientation for developing production , and acquired the advantage in structure that was developed earlier than others .
it is not as simple as building some large projects , " said wang lequan , a deputy to the national people 's congress , and secretary of the party committee of xinjiang uygur autonomous region , in an interview with this reporter .
wang lequan said : the extensive development of western regions constitutes a major readjustment of the layout of china 's modern economic development .
this is not only a geographic concept but also a kind of concept that embodies the economic development situation .
in developing the west , we will never use the methods we used to develop the coastal open cities in the past .
in fact , western regions do not have the condition to open to the outside world .
as a typical representative of the western regions , xinjiang must translate its resource advantages into industrial and product advantages .
to develop the west , the state will certainly invest enormous funds in it . however , instead of depending on state investment , xinjiang should give full play to its own efforts , because the opportunity can be seized with its own efforts only .
how much opportunity it can seize depends on how much effort it makes .
when practicing the strategy of extensively developing western regions , it is necessary to conduct scientific appraisal in line with actual circumstances and accelerate the preparations in all aspects .
xinjiang should take advantage of this strategy to help its cadres and masses change their concepts , get rid of the ideas of " waiting for , depending on , and asking from the state , " and work earnestly and skillfully .
xinjiang should enhance the sense of pioneering and competition and foster the modern concept .
in addition , xinjiang must base itself on the present , keep its eyes on the future , and attend to the current work in a down - to - earth manner .
he maintained : to extensively develop the west , xinjiang has to initiate some large projects , including water conservancy , highway , railway , power , and aviation projects .
in building these projects , it must make overall plans for decision , construction , and completion of projects ; must give prominence to key aspects , and must build projects step by step .
at the same time , xinjiang should take the path of developing a distinctive and high - efficient agriculture .
in this aspect , xinjiang has plenty of opportunities . for instance , there are such " red industry " as tomatoes , safflowers , and wolfberry . there are also many unique melons and fruits .
wang lequan indicated : in the field of industrial production , xinjiang will devote its major energy to renovating traditional industries and utilizing its distinctive agricultural products and mineral resources to produce its unique industrial products .
xinjiang will also intensify the prospecting of natural petroleum gas resources and the chemical industrial resources , two of xinjiang 's three major industries .
xinjiang will do realistic and reliable work to facilitate the early start of the magnificent project of " transmitting gas from the west to the east , " to shanghai .
xinjiang will also endeavor to fulfill the strategic shift of the state natural petroleum gas industry and complete the building of china 's largest natural petroleum gas and chemical industrial base .
he also indicated : we will vigorously develop the tourism and accelerate the building of tourist infrastructure in a bid to build tourism into a new economic growth point of xinjiang .
at the same time , we will gradually carry out the plan of " building another beautiful grand northwest . "
xinjiang 's ecological environment is extremely weak , thus the task in this aspect is extremely arduous .
at present , xinjiang has already banned the cutting of forests .
wang lequan maintained : in carrying out the strategy of extensively developing western regions , there are still many unfavorable factors in xinjiang , the most serious one of which is the factor of people .
xinjiang is a region where a variety of ethnic nationalities live in compact communities and where a variety of languages are used .
thus , it is particularly important and urgent to rapidly train professionals and improve the quality of the entire labor force .
wang lequan added : the extensive development of the western regions , including xinjiang , is a systems engineering . to succeed with this , we need not only great enthusiasm but also reason , wisdom , and the unremitting efforts of the people of several generations .
in the past year , the non - public economies in our country have made further development .
they not only absorbed large quantities of rural surplus labor force , but also absorbed large numbers of workers being laid off by state - owned enterprises . in 1998 , more than 4.6 million people were absorbed by these enterprises . "
committee member li zuke from fujian said : the rapid development of the non - public economies satisfied the diversified demand of the masses , contributed considerable taxes , and formed a new growth point in the national economy .
in recent years , some people - owned enterprises also made investment in the central and western regions in response to the party and the government 's call , opened up rural markets , and used their concrete actions to promote economic development in the less developed areas .
practice shows that the non - public economies are playing a positive role in local economic development .
committee member jin yi said , " some leading cadres talked a lot about the importance of developing non - public economies , but in their minds and conceptions , they did not really understand and realize this .
once the departmental interests are touched , they tended to get up to little tricks . this was reflected by the fact that 'three irregulars ' still occurred from time to time though repeated orders were issued to stop the malpractice . "
it is also hard to implement the financial policies .
li zuke said : people - owned enterprises can only rely on self - accumulation to get the funds they need , or contract loans privately at high costs .
at present , some commercial banks take the scale of assets as a main criterion for determining an enterprise 's credit rating while arranging secured loans .
most non - public enterprises are operating by renting land or property , and cannot take much fixed assets as collateral or find guarantor institutions . as a result , it is very difficult for them to contract loans from the banks as working funds .
individual and private enterprises are facing many " managing " institutions , and find it hard to engage in a lawsuit .
committee member li zuke said : individual and private enterprises are beyond the management of the governments , but they are still facing the " management " of many institutions .
when something is lucrative , many institutions contend with each other to have a hand in it ; but bucks are passed to each other when something really requires effective management .
events of infringing upon the legitimate rights and interests of the enterprises occur from time to time . due to the lack of pertinent laws and regulations , individual and private enterprises find it hard to file complaints and launch a lawsuit .
some enterprises simply stop lodging complaints while being victimized and just take the events as their bad luck , or resort some illegal means to seek " justice . "
such state of affairs should be changed .
find the right positions again , turning themselves into modern enterprises , upgrading their own quality [ subhead ] " most owners of non - public enterprises do business according to their intuition in the market competition , and are short of the basic expertise in industrial management . "
wu zhendde , vice chairman of the democratic league central committee and vice chairman of the cppcc sichuan provincial committee , said , " when their products are in shortage on the market , such operational mode may still grasp some opportunities by luck .
when products become abundant , without a certain level of management means and business insight , it will be hard for them to continue to survive and develop . "
it is necessary for them to find their right positions again .
wu zhengde said : non - public enterprises should change their developmental mode of being " small and comprehensive , " and reshape themselves in the orientation of being " small and specialized and streamlined . "
they should adjust the position of their products in the market , find a correct entry point , and play an active role in supporting some large enterprises as their part suppliers .
they need to correctly grasp the trend of the market , and carry out technological innovations .
entrepreneurs who run the non - public enterprises should pay attention to " upgrade " themselves .
" as the new growth point and propeller of the economy as a whole , non - public enterprises will make great contributions to our society .
the two types of resources and markets at home and abroad should be fully used to serve the purpose of pushing our national economy onto a new stage . "
beijing , 10 mar ( xinhua ) - - some 10 years ago , zhang hongwei was merely a responsible person of an engineering team in harbin .
now , his business , the eastern group , has established its footholds in dozens of countries and regions in the world .
speaking of competition , cppcc member zhang hongwei says : the economic globalization trend has intensified competition in the market .
setting up a number of big internationally competitive transnational companies based on modern enterprise management is the only choice that china should make if it is to stand firm in the world economy .
develop the domestic economy with an eye on the world in august 1979 , the state council issued a document , stating explicitly that we should go out to establish overseas enterprises .
this policy opened an avenue for chinese enterprises to develop transnational business .
facts have proved that transnational business is not an exclusive " patent " of western developed countries . we , too , can build our own transnational companies to seek and share interests in world economic development .
for example , increasing the export of labor - intensive products can provide a lot of job opportunities at home .
for this reason , he says , we should encourage robust enterprises to make investments and set up plants abroad , develop processing trade , or engage in such overseas business projects as cooperative development of resources , contractual construction work , and labor cooperation .
the past few years have seen a large number of transnational companies coming to china , and as a result , the amount of foreign investment in this country has kept growing .
the large amount of in - bound capital and especially the arrival of big transnational companies one after another imply that china has a good prospect in the eyes of the world .
in the tidal waves of economic globalization , if we are unable to surf , we will drown .
so far , however , few chinese brands are well - known internationally .
there is a wide gap between what we have achieved and the advanced international level whether in terms of the production scale or technology , management expertise or product quality , entrepreneurs ' talent or workers ' abilities .
the cppcc members say that , on the one hand , the above situation is due to our lack of awareness of the importance of brands ; on the other hand , it shows our poor management work in creating international brands .
happily , however , some of our domestic enterprises , such as " hai er , " have given up their price - oriented strategy and begun to rely on high product quality , efficient marketing , and good after - sales service to compete in the international market .
there is no denying the fact that chinese - invested overseas enterprises are comparatively small businesses , their scales far below the average of those of developed countries .
such being the case , they not only have no sufficient strength to compete with big foreign enterprises , but are unable to expand production .
to enhance our " global concept , " we also need to raise the competitiveness of our enterprises , especially big and medium - sized enterprises , to the world level .
in this regard , cppcc member bai dahua says : compared with big transnational companies , ours are weak ones .
in addition , we must boost the competitiveness of our big enterprises , including transnational companies , by improving the properties and quality of their products , lowering their production costs and product prices , and raising the level of their after - sales service .
in the new century , competition among countries will manifest itself even more strikingly as a test of economic strength .
just as cppcc member chen kaizhi has said , at the crucial movement of the turn of the century , we should focus on cultivating a number of enterprises with great potentials so that they may distinguish themselves and display our national strength on the international arena .
ideological and political work is an important guarantee for victory the monument to people 's heroes towering over tiananmen square and the magnificent great hall of the people nearby seem to link history and the future .
the cpc has taken marxism as its guiding ideology since the day it was founded .
in the wake of the continual development of the chinese revolution and construction , mao zedong thought and deng xiaoping theory have been successively written into the party constitution .
recalling the past and comparing it with the present , the deputies and committee members pointed out that the banner is the soul of the party 's ideological and political work .
chen yuyi , a hainan member of the cppcc national committee , said that our party has been severely tested time after time in the process of revolution and construction . after every setback , however , it has gathered itself together afresh and continued the struggle .
this could not have been achieved without the party 's ideological and political work , moreover , the more crucial the moment , the more important is ideological and political work .
this has been proven not only by the practice of the chinese revolution and construction in the past , but also by the great practice of building socialism with chinese characteristics since the launch of reform and opening up .
the deputies and committee members had deep feelings as they recalled the reform process .
the more that reforms and opening up proceed , the more necessary it is to strengthen ideological and political work the vitality of ideological and political work lies in its continual development and perfection in line with the changes in the objective situation .
the focal point and method of ideological and political work in every period are consistently strengthened and improved in line with the changes in the current difficult problems .
the current tv serial " how to make steel " has made waves in the minds of many of the deputies and committee members during the " two sessions . "
ye danian , a member of the science association panel , said that people of this generation profoundly feel the impact of " how to make steel . "
the reason why ( paul kochakin ) has immortal vitality lies in his staunch ideals and faith and his high - spirited attitude to life .
encouraging people with outstanding artistic works is an important aspect of ideological and political work .
in particular , the cpc central committee 's decisive handling of the " falun gong " problem last year enabled the cadres and masses to gain further understanding of the importance and urgency of stepping up and improving ideological and political work .
ideological and political work is essential in cultivating a high - quality force to give the enterprise cohesion .
the " three stresses " education now unfolding among county - level leading cadres and leadership groups has evoked an enthusiastic reaction among the deputies and committee members .
many of them pointed out that people have been encouraged by the action of jiang zemin and other members of the politburo standing committee in going deep into the grass roots and taking the lead in mobilizing the launch of " three stresses " education at county level .
deputy wang zhaohua , deputy secretary of the fengning county cpc committee in hebei , held that the " three stresses " education is an important exploration in party building in the new period and also an important form of ideological and political work .
so long as we do a thoroughly good job in this , we will be able to strengthen our ideals and faith , increase party spirit , unite the masses , and boost the combat strength and cohesion of the party organizations .
the new century and new tasks set new demands on ideological and political work " on 22 february , general secretary jiang zemin came to our village to investigate and study grassroots party building and listen to the views of the grassroots masses .
deputy zhang weiji , secretary of the general party branch of nanling village of buji town in longgang district of shenzhen , spoke of how he is still moved by the scene when general secretary jiang zemin inspected nanling village .
" think of the source when getting rich , advance in thinking when getting rich " ; this is general secretary jiang zemin 's call to the cadres and masses , especially those in regions where development is relatively fast .
guangdong 's npc deputies said : building socialism with chinese characteristics includes the two aspects of developing material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization , and it is necessary to achieve coordinated economic and social development and all - round progress .
faced with the imminent new century , the deputies and committee members pointed out that china 's future brilliance must be forged by high - quality talent .
the key to achieving the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation lies in seizing the opportunity , doing our own business well , and cultivating our talent well .
the " falun gong " phenomenon which appeared not long ago shows that there are still weak links in ideological and political work .
many deputies and committee members pointed out that ideological and political work is systems engineering , and it is necessary to make overall plans and comprehensive arrangements for it .
ideological and political work must be placed in and serve the overall situation , and cannot just concentrate on one thing .
it is necessary to bring into play the role of the ideological and political work departments , and also depend on all sectors of society , to form a combined force in ideological and political work .
bilateral negotiations on china 's accession to the wto have speeded up significantly recently .
china signed bilateral agreements with colombia and thailand successively this week , and eu trade commissioner lamy will also come to china at the end of this month to conduct ministerial consultations with shi guangsheng .
in the negotiation process for china 's wto bid , 37 members asked to conduct bilateral negotiations with china .

beijing , 10 march ( xinhua ) - - the ninth standing committee meeting of the ninth cppcc [ chinese people 's political consultative conference ] national committee was held in beijing this afternoon .
the meeting was presided over by li ruihuan , member of the standing committee of the political bureau of the cpc central committee and chairman of the cppcc national committee .
entrusted by a meeting of the cppcc national committee chairmen , zheng wantong , secretary general of the cppcc national committee , reported to the meeting on the situation and progress of the third session of the ninth cppcc national committee and the main situation of its panel discussions .
the members also attended as non - voting delegates the third plenary session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] during which they listened to and discussed the government work report and the planning and financial reports .
the 48 groups of members have held seven rounds of panel discussions respectively .
the session has proceeded smoothly in accordance with its agenda and as scheduled with a relatively high attendance rate and a heated atmosphere at its panel discussions .
the leading comrades concerned from the cpc central committee and the state council listened to the speeches during the session .
this is the first time over the past many years that such a large number of leading comrades from the state council or ministries or commissions concerned have come to listen to the speeches during the session or attend the panel discussions held by the members .
the members also advanced some views on how to revise this year 's government work report . the secretariat of the session has generalized and passed on those views to the general office of the state council .
zheng said : the members generally held that the work report of the standing committee of the cppcc national committee is a report aimed at seeking truth from facts and marked by comprehensive contents , clear - cut emphases , concise wordings , and salient characteristics .
moreover , the members also put forth some views on how to revise the work report , which have been summed up and divided into some 40 categories .
the secretariat of the session has instructed the document drafting group to conscientiously revise the work report in accordance with the members ' views , stressing : the work report should be revised in accordance with the members ' views wherever it may or may not be revised .
the meeting mourned with deep grief the loss of gongtangcang danbeiwangxu and xie xide , two standing committee members who had passed away due to sickness , since the eighth standing committee meeting of the ninth cppcc national committee .
wen jiabao said : the extensive development of western regions was a grand systems engineering involving various economic and social aspects .
therefore , the ideas must be unified , and arrangements must be careful .
wen jiabao indicated : in extensively developing western regions , we must have good plans .
when studying and making plans , we should proceed from reality , observe the objective law , and give full consideration to various localities ' natural and geographical conditions as well as the real condition of economic and social development in order to make the plans more scientific .
wen jiabao said : in extensively developing western regions , we must have good ideas .
to this end , we should actively promote the transformation of economic structure and economic growth pattern and strive to improve the utilization efficiency of natural resources in western regions , the utilization benefit of funds , and the quality of economic growth .
wen jiabao also called for strengthening leadership in developing the west .
he said : we should make positive explorations , summarize experience in a timely manner , suit measures to local conditions , and give different guidance based on different situations .
we should give full play to political advantages to mobilize the whole society to support the development of the west .
all this reflected china 's military stance to a great extent .
every time china increases its military spending , the western media will certainly play up the move and link with the so - called " china threat theory . "
however , such a phenomenon was rather rarely seen this year .
china stated long ago that the increased military spending this year would be used mainly in increasing the salaries of officers and men in the army and improving their living standards rather than boosting arms expansion .
the military will get a pay increase of about 30 percent this year , which is not considered an enormous rise compared to local cadres in terms of salary and allowances .
therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .
for this purpose , [ finance minister ] xiang huaicheng pronounced allocating an additional 5.6 billion yuan for the army and armed police forces to cover the necessary expenditures for the performance of their functions .
china is still among the countries with the lowest per capita defense expenditures . according to statistics , china 's national defense expenditures this year continued at just 1 percent of its gnp , lower than the world 's average of 3 percent .
compared to the state budgets of the united states and japan , in china 's state budget , expenditures for national defense are very low .
japan 's general national defense expenditures this fiscal year totaled 4,940 billion japanese yen ( or about $ 48 billion ) or more than 3 times that of china 's national defense expenditures .
this shows china 's per capita military expenditure is at such a low level .
nevertheless , the chinese army , which is celebrated for its industriousness and stamina , can bring its enthusiasm and creativity into full play , push national defense and army modernization to a new stage , and enhance its defense combat capability to a new level .
now we can declare to the whole world that the great task of reducing the size of the pla by 500,000 , set forth by the party 's 15th national congress , was fulfilled at the end of last year .
this indicates that our army has taken a great step toward the objectives of " streamlining , merging , and efficiency . "
meanwhile , remarkable results were achieved in the " three stresses " education , and the coherence and combat capacity of party committees at all levels were strengthened as well .
the upsurge of mass scientific and technological training was set off across the pla units , and joint military exercises of all services and arms of nanjing and guangzhou theaters were thoroughly organized and conducted .
major headway was made in building national defense - oriented science and technology as well as armaments , and a long - range surface - to - surface missile and the experimental spacecraft " shenzhou " were successfully launched .
the socialization of logistics support and other reform items were promoted actively , and all the preparations for kicking off the joint service system were completed on schedule .
the grand military review for celebrating the 50th founding anniversary of new china demonstrated to the whole world our army 's fine spiritual outlook and tremendous achievements in modernization . this military review also greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm and the national pride of the people throughout the country .
the macao troops were smoothly stationed in macao to perform their defense duties , and they were warmly received by macao compatriots .
jiang zemin particularly stressed : because hegemony and power politics have developed anew , so we should have a strong sense of suffering .
all pla officers and men should firmly embrace the concept of preparedness against war and constantly enhance the army 's deterrent capacity and actual combat capacity .
the stronger our national defense strength is , the greater the guarantee for our country 's security and fulfillment of the great cause of reunification will be .
at his speech at the npc session , a certain military region 's deputy commander said : china has made full military preparations .
meanwhile , on the same occasion , a local military commander proposed the npc enact a " national defense mobilization law " or a " war mobilization law " as soon as possible in view of the present situation and work out legal provisions concerning issues of overall significance .
another officer proposed strengthening the implementation of the " air defense law " and more effectively building up air defense in coastal cities so as to cope with changes in the situation of the taiwan strait .
he stressed that the eastern coastal areas should advance in greater strides in taking the lead in realizing modernization in main areas .
wen jiabao said : general secretary jiang zemin recently called for conducting education on the subject of " thinking of the source and making further advances when becoming rich " in guangdong .
" advances " refer to the grasping of current opportunities without letting them go , opening up new grounds and making new progress without sticking to old ways , and comprehensively pushing ahead reforms , opening up , and the cause of socialist modernization .
wen jiabao required that the eastern coastal areas deeply understand the essence of general secretary jiang zemin 's speech , further give play to their own advantages , advance in greater strides in taking the lead in realizing modernization in main areas .
first , it is necessary to grasp the opportunities and speed up development .
the principle of expanding domestic demand should be firmly carried out , thus guaranteeing the sustained , high speed , and healthy development of the national economy .
second , it is necessary to carry out strategic adjustments of the economic structure , and enhance the quality of efficiency of economic growth .
fourth , it is necessary to further deepen the economic structural reform with focus on reforms in state - owned enterprises , and further improve and perfect the socialist market economic structure .
the scope of opening up should be further expanded .
the contents of opening up should be raised to a new level .
while continuing to do a good job in attracting foreign funds and technologies , it is also necessary to pursue the opening strategy of " going out " and enhance the international competitive power of our country 's enterprises and products .
sixth , it is necessary to further enhance the level of our people 's material and cultural lives , and make our people better - off on the basis of reaching the standard of being comparatively well - off .
while examining and discussing the two reports , the deputies and members also maintained that our country 's judicial contingent has made immense contributions toward safeguarding social and political stability and safeguarding the order of the market economy .
gong zheng , a deputy from jiangxi , said that the judicial contingent in general has carried out intensive education and revamp with significant results .
" the government has given the task of strengthening judicial construction and fighting corruption a fairly high priority , " said member zhong an .
upholding judicial justice means strictly following the law , strictly enforcing the law , and strictly prosecuting violations of law .
however , we must be soberly aware that the problem of judicial corruption has not been fully resolved and is actually becoming more widespread in some localities .
the act of abusing one 's power in exchange for money is polluting the social trend , causing extremely severe harm and affecting economic development and social stability .
member chen chunlong said the trial of court president yao xiaohong reflects the lack of strong judicial restraint and supervision .
member chen kaichi said that , in recent years , some verdicts of the people 's courts were not enforced and legal rights and interests of litigants were not protected in a timely and effective way , to which the masses have expressed strong opinions .
we must take vigorous steps to resolve the problem of " difficulty in enforcement , " strive to safeguard the authority of judicial organs , and build our country into one that is ruled by law .
some deputies and members also pointed out that although the work of fighting corruption and promoting a clean government in our country has achieved significant results in recent years , it still falls short of the central authorities ' requirement and the people 's expectation .
we must adopt stronger measures , clean up the contingents , eradicate corruption , and , by setting up proper systems , ensure that judicial organs fulfill their duties according to law .
under the situation whereby the legislative system is constantly being perfected and new laws are being formulated , we must strengthen study of new knowledge .
during today 's examination and discussion , many deputies and members held the view that the two reports pointed out a clear direction for perfecting judicial construction .
establishment and perfection of these systems will provide a strong and powerful guarantee for promoting governing of the country according to law and for building our country 's socialist market economy .
jiang zemin , general secretary of the cpc central committee and state president , participated in the shanxi and guizhou delegations ' plenary meetings of the third session of the ninth national people 's congress one after the other in the great hall of the people this afternoon .
at the meetings of the two delegations , deputies from shanxi and guizhou respectively took the floor in light of their local conditions .
the deputies spoke enthusiastically one after another in a very friendly atmosphere .
jiang zemin attentively listened to their speeches and frequently discussed some issues with the deputies .
having listened to the speeches made by the deputies of the shanxi delegation , jiang zemin said : shanxi was an old base area , which had made tremendous contributions to the chinese revolution during the war of resistance against the japanese aggression and the war of liberation .
after the liberation , shanxi has become an important base of energy resources and heavy chemical industry , and energetically supported the economic construction of the entire country .
since reform and opening up , shanxi province has made achievements in various fields , which deserves full affirmation .
the adjustment of the economic structure is an inexorable requirement for the economic development at the present stage and a major measure to resolve the deep - level contradictions of the economic development .
at present , it is the opportune moment favorable for the structural adjustment .
in face of the increasingly fierce market competition , if we fail to speed up the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , we will find it very hard to hold an advantageous position in international competition and attain a new and still greater development in the national economy .
we must deepen our understanding , intensify our sense of urgency , and enhance our consciousness and initiative in the structural adjustment .
it is necessary to pay particular attention to the following aspects : 1 ) stabilizing and strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation , further stepping up the construction of agricultural infrastructure facilities , protecting cultivated land , and heightening the ability of agricultural comprehensive production .
2 ) adjusting the industrial structure and product mix , cutting down the excessive production capabilities , reducing the industries that produce unmarketable products , and shutting down and eliminating the enterprises using backward technologies , polluting environment , wasting resources , and lacking conditions for safe production .
3 ) adjusting the structure of the enterprises which are excessively decentralized and unable to form a sufficient scale , and vigorously pushing forward enterprises ' association , merger , and reorganization .
4 ) using new high technology to transform the traditional industries and adjusting and transforming the old industrial bases to enable the traditional industries and old industrial bases to radiate new vitality .
5 ) selectively expediting the development of new hi - tech industries and positively cultivating new economic growth points .
6 ) energetically developing the tertiary industry , particularly in such trades as information , finance , tourism , service , and so on , and broadening the paths for employment .
7 ) promoting the rational distribution and coordinated development of the regional economy and urban - rural economy , making efforts to display the advantages of various localities , and reasonably developing and utilizing resources to bring about the healthy development of the regional economy .
with regard to the adjustment of economic structure , jiang zemin pointed out : first , it is necessary to keep the overall situation in mind and make overall planning appropriately .
the structural adjustment that we are making is a comprehensive rather than partial one , and is a major strategic measure rather than a temporary expedient . the structural adjustment should be suited to the international economic development trend .
while vigorously developing the new hi - tech industries and transforming the traditional industries , we should positively develop the labor - intensive industries in light of china 's national conditions , as they call for smaller investment and absorb more labor forces .
second , we should positively bring into full play the guiding role of the market .
third , serious attention should be paid to the role of science and technology and the elevation of our ability in development and innovation .
it is necessary to positively import advanced applicable technologies , enhance our ability to make innovation by ourselves , and vigorously develop new technology and new craft that have our own intellectual property rights .
fourth , the strategic adjustment of the national economy should be closely combined with the optimization and upgrading of the economic structure and the adjustment and perfection of the ownership structure .
fifth , in accelerating the structural adjustment , it is imperative to properly perform the mass work and maintain social stability .
after listening to the speeches of the deputies from guizhou , jiang zemin said : guizhou is one of the provinces and autonomous regions in west china that are faced with the greatest difficulty because of its comparatively poor natural conditions and relatively weak economic foundation .
jiang zemin pointed out that the strategy for the large - scale development in west china put forth by the central authorities is aimed at expediting the development in the central and western regions and promoting the coordinated development of the regional economy .
in the new century , the vast western region must hold fast to the center of economic construction , firmly seize the historical opportunity of developing the western region on a large scale , fully display its own advantages , and quicken the pace of its development .
since reform and opening up , particularly since the middle of 1980's when the state started the development of assisting the poor on a large scale in a planned way , tremendous achievements have been scored by china in its poverty relief work .
in the impoverished areas , the solution of the food and clothing problem for the masses should be taken as the most important and urgent task at the moment , which should be placed in the foremost position for accomplishment .
owing to the objective conditions and historical reasons , there is a great imbalance in the development of different regions , and the impoverished areas , impoverished population , and impoverished phenomena will exist in china for a long time .
the initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .
after the state 's plan of resolving the 80 million people 's food and clothing problem in seven years is carried out , the task of poverty relief will not come to an end . instead , it will enter a new stage .
during the tenth five - year plan period and even a longer period to come , we should still have a good grasp of the poverty relief work unremittingly .
the party committees and governments at all levels should foster an idea of protracted battle and continue to place the development to assist the poor in an important position when drafting the plans for national economic and social development .
jiang zemin said emphatically : at present , to do a good job of poverty relief and push forward the rural economic development , first , we should adhere to the principle of assisting the poor through development .
second , we should accelerate the development in education , popularize applicable techniques , and universally elevate the laborers ' quality .
this is a major prerequisite for getting rid of poverty to become prosperous , and is also where the stamina for economic development lies .
third , we should lay a solid foundation for agricultural development .
in the impoverished areas , agriculture holds a large proportion in the economy , the source of peasants ' income mainly depends on agriculture , and a considerable portion of the local financial revenue also comes from agriculture .
it is necessary to develop agriculture with high yield , fine quality , and great efficiency , heighten the economic results of agriculture , and increase peasants ' incomes .
cao zhi , vice chairman of the standing committee of the national people 's congress , attended the meeting of the guizhou delegation .
jiang zemin , li peng , zhu rongji , hu jintao , wei jianxing , li lanqing and other party and state leaders were seated on the rostrum .
the meeting was presided over by wu jieping , executive chairman of the session and executive member of the presidium .
xiao yang , president of the supreme people 's court , made a report on the work of the supreme people 's court at the meeting .
he said the people 's courts have attained some achievements , but they still have much to do before they can meet the requirements of the party and the people . there are also many problems and difficulties that should not be overlooked .
regarding the work of the people 's courts this year , xiao yang put forward the necessity of continuing to deepen court reform , ensure judicial justice , serving the overall interests of the country , and safeguarding social stability .
the level of trying cases and implementing rulings should be further raised , new achievements should be made in court reform , and new progress should be made in the building of personnel .
han zhubin , procurator general of the supreme people 's procuratorate , made a report to the meeting on the work of the supreme people 's procuratorate .
he said in 1999 , procuratorial organs at all levels severely cracked down on serious crimes according to law , and made positive contribution to safeguarding social stability .
in the past year , remarkable achievements have been made in the building of procuratorial personnel , and new breakthroughs have been made in procuratorial reform .
he said we are soberly aware that many shortcomings and problems still exist in procuratorial work and the people are still not satisfied with many aspects of our work .
han zhubin said procuratorial organs at all level must persistently regard the quality of handling cases as the lifeline of law - enforcement work , and persistently take the people 's satisfaction as the highest standard .
they must follow the requirements of administering the country according to law , comply with the people 's demands , and earnestly perform the duty of supervising lawsuits entrusted by laws .
they must punish criminals , help those who have taken a wrong step in life , educate those who have made mistakes , protect the innocent , and support reformers .
" ruling the country by law and ensuring judicial justice " has been a focal point of popular concern in recent years . it is also the focus of attention of npc deputies and cppcc members during their annual sessions .
the npc deputies and cppcc members raised the view that judicial justice is a fundamental guarantee for promoting the implementation of the principle of ruling the country by law .
if the masses lose their confidence in their judicial organs , the image of the party and government among the masses will be seriously undermined . thus , the phenomenon of judicial corruption simply cannot be taken lightly .
to whom is the alarm intended ? people may still remember that at the first session of the ninth npc two years ago , many deputies returned a vote of veto or abstention to the reports of the " two supremes . "
today , people have noted with great pleasure that the reports of the " two supremes " were greeted by rounds of applause at the third session of the ninth npc .
these applauses showed the affirmation and encouragement people gave to the efforts and achievements made by the " two supremes " in punishing judicial corruption and defending judicial justice .
guangdong deputy tang shurong [ 0781 3219 5554 ] said : in the process of building a socialist country ruled by law , it is only by relying on judicial justice that the rights and interests of the broad masses of the people can be truly protected .
there is a close relationship between judicial justice and the protection of the interests of the masses by judicial organs .
injustice in law enforcement and corruption in the judiciary have occurred from time to time .
the popular saying , " like a big lip cap with two ends sticking out , it gets at both the defendant and the plaintiff , " reflects the bitter hatred harbored by the masses against corruption in the judiciary .
the npc deputies and cppcc members were deeply aware of the seriousness of the problem of violation of law and discipline among a handful of judicial officials .
corruption in the judiciary is extremely harmful . it is an important factor that breeds and abets corruption in other areas .
cppcc member wang houde [ 3769 0624 1795 ] said : " the harm done by an unjust trial is worse than 10 crimes .
crime is like polluted water , and unjust sentence is like a polluted source .
if the source is polluted , there is no point trying to treat the water . "
npc deputy sun guihua [ 1327 2710 5478 ] , an old - timer in judicial work , said : judicial justice is the basic requirement for ruling the country by law . it is the strong aspirations of the masses and the lifeline of judiciary organs .
if a society loses judicial justice , it cannot begin to talk about social justice .
turning ardent hopes into a powerful drive the ardent hopes of npc deputies and cppcc members have turned into a powerful drive in improving the work of the " two supremes , " and a substantial step forward has been taken .
in last year alone , the supreme people 's procuratorate has dispatched 11 work teams to 24 provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities directly under central administration to call on more than 200 npc deputies .
if you want to work with iron , you must be tough yourself .
having learned from the opinions and suggestions of npc deputies and cppcc members , the " two supremes " made continuous attempts to improve their mechanism of constraint and intensified their reform and rectification .
the supreme people 's court increased the transparency of adjudication by putting it under the direct supervision of members of the public through open trial , live broadcast and other methods .
this produced a strong response from the public , who hailed it as " trial under the sun . "
procuratorial organs throughout the country are " making public the prosecution process " by announcing to the public their functions and powers , scope of cases accepted for prosecution , the law enforcement process , and so on .
people now understand that if they do not agree with the decision in a civil or administrative judgment , they can still lodge an appeal with procuratorial organs .
the supreme people 's court and the supreme people 's procuratorate unfolded activities of education , rectification and law - enforcement inspection in an all - round way with salient problems among their officials in mind .
" personal favor cases , " " social connection cases " and " money cases " became the key targets of this education and rectification .
in october 1997 , the standing committee of the hainan provincial people 's congress passed the regulations on the investigation of wrongly - charged cases .
through practice , " the investigation of wrongly - charged cases " was promoted throughout the country . this effectively checked and prevented corruption in law enforcement .
since implementing the system of investigating wrongly - charged cases , hangzhou has called to account 13 people who were responsible for the trial of these cases .
sincere efforts have won the genuine support of npc deputies and cppcc members .
as an old deputy , i will give positive support and assistance to the judicial organs in their judicial and procuratorial work .
beefing up the system of supervision to promote judicial justice the npc deputies and cppcc members all agreed that power without supervision would lead to the abuse of power for selfish ends and undermine state laws , and could even lead to corruption .
they saw the strengthening of supervision as an important measure for ensuring judicial justice .
in order to beef up the system of supervision and defend judicial justice , it is necessary first of all to strengthen npc supervision over judicial organs .
npc deputy yu wanling [ 0060 8001 1545 ] said : as the supreme organ of state power , the npc should play a bigger role in judicial supervision .
we must further intensify our efforts , improve on the methods and procedures , and pay attention to quality , in order not to let the people down .
the standing committee of the provincial people 's congress subsequently adopted a resolution dismissing this judge .
through this incident , people were pleased to see the constant strengthening of the role of people 's congresses in defending judicial justice .
in order to beef up the system of supervision and defend judicial justice , it is also necessary to improve the mechanisms of internal supervision and constraint in judicial organs .
jiangsu deputy yu guangzhou [ 0060 1639 3166 ] held that in truly defending the dignity of the law and maintaining judicial justice , the key lies in institutional guarantee .
improving the process of supervision and making it more than a mere form is a new task confronting the judiciary .
these strict measures have built an escape - proof net against corrupt officials in the judiciary .
the npc deputies and cppcc members maintained that in strengthening the system of supervision and defending judicial justice , it is also necessary to fully bring into play the role of supervision by the masses and by the news media .
with the subsequent live - broadcast of court hearings , the masses can " see with their own eyes " the " inside story " of these hearings at home .
cppcc member quan shuren [ 0356 2885 0088 ] said : it is also necessary to follow the " mass line " in defending judicial justice .
the masses not only can effectively supervise the judicial process and improve the law - enforcement environment , but can educate themselves in the process .
power comes from the people , and supervision is the most effective " anti - corrosive agent . "
effective supervision is an important guarantee for judicial justice . we believe that when all law - enforcement personnel are subject to strict supervision and act according to law , the target of judicial justice can definitely be met .
nine hebei delegates spoke at the meeting .
their remarks touched mainly on issues that range from relying on laws to manage the country , to enhance the building of the rank of judges , to publicize legal system education , to deepening the reform , and to change of government functions .
delegate wang jialin called for deepening reform of financial structure , managing finances according to law , strict managing financial matters , and for enhancing supervision from an overall perspective .
zhang qinhua urged enhancing the training and managing public servants ' education and training , fostering in them the concept of administration according to law , raising work efficiency , and increasing awareness for services .
delegate zhao jun suggested quickening pace of reforming court personnel system and training a contingent of quality judges as soon as possible .
in addition to doing well in legislative work , she also suggested enhancing law enforcement supervision , so that laws will be relied on , laws will be strictly enforced , and illegal acts will be punished .
delegate yu tianrui put forth the suggestion of earnestly strengthening grassroots party organization building in rural areas and of raising the quality of grassroots party - member cadres .
he urged for intensifying the fight against corruption , the efforts to promote honest and clean administration , for opposing unhealthy tendencies , and for strictly punishing corrupt elements .
first , serving the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental purpose of our party . we should enhance the education of party member cadres , leading cadres in particular , and help them establish a correct world outlook and outlook on life .
second , exert great effort against corruption .
punishment should be meted out according to law to whomever who breaches disciplines and violate laws .
there is a need to further improve laws and regulations and to strictly enforce laws .
third , efforts are needed to stem out areas that breed corruption .
we need to actively establish a sound and effective supervision mechanism , avoid interest - motivated government behavior , set up a mechanism to eliminate powers - for - money deals , and enhance supervision over government personnel and state - owned enterprise personnel .
he also said that changing fees into taxes is a fundamental measure to lighten farmers ' burdens and as anhui was made a pilot province to experiment with changing fees into taxes , the preparations work in that regard has been in full swing .
he added that anhui would surely engage in meticulous organization , make conscientious arrangements , and implement measures in a planned manner .
following the delegates ' remarks , hu jintao spoke mainly on the agricultural and rural work .
he pointed out that china has always prioritized solving well the problem of feeding 1.2 billion people .
it is necessary to pay high attention to agriculture to realize china 's cross - century development goals .
it is necessary to always show care for farmers ' personal interests , to prioritize the work of lightening farmers ' burdens , and to mobilize farmers ' initiatives to the greatest extent possible .
hu jintao stressed that grassroots party organizations in rural areas are the foundation of the party 's entire work and combat strength in rural areas .
before promoting grassroots organization building , one must first of all do well in building the contingent of grassroots cadres .
there is also a need to gradually establish a sound supervision and encouragement mechanism for grassroots cadres , and to actively explore effective ways and methods of standardizing management of grassroots cadres in rural areas .
at present , both sino - us relations and cross - strait relations are at an extremely important and crucial moment .
despite such a sensitive time , the us government has ignored china 's strong opposition and is ready to sell advanced weapons to taiwan , deliberately undermining sino - us relations and intensifying the tense situation in the taiwan strait .
tang jiaxuan pointed out that what the united states has done has encouraged the arrogance of the splittist forces in taiwan and the united states bears unshirkable responsibility for the tense situation in the taiwan strait .
over a long time , the successive us governments have regarded taiwan as an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " for containing china .
after china and the united states established diplomatic relations , the united states was compelled to withdraw its troops from taiwan , but it immediately adopted the " taiwan relations act " bill and undertook the responsibility of using force to defend taiwan .
therefore , to settle the taiwan issue , it is imperative to get rid of us interference and to properly make preparation for military struggle .
speaking about the taiwan issue on 4 march , president jiang zemin pointed out , " the chinese people have never been afraid of ghosts and have never believed in fallacies . we resolutely oppose any evil move that will endanger the fundamental interests of the chinese nation .
the greater the national defense strength is , the better china 's security and the realization of the great cause of reunification are guaranteed .
sino - us relations are of utmost importance to peace and stability in the asia - pacific region , and to peace and stability of the world as whole .
at present whatever the united states says on the taiwan issue will have a direct bearing on the direction along which sino - us relations will move , and will also have a direct bearing on peace and stability in the taiwan strait and the asia - pacific region .
in what direction will sino - us relations move lies entirely with the united states .
beijing , 11 mar ( xinhua ) - - " once china enters the wto , both the mainland and hong kong will face an unprecedented new situation .
ltd . [ name as transliterated ] .
china 's entry into the wto has been a hot topic of discussion by the cppcc members from hong kong during this year 's " two sessions . "
member lu tsung - lin said that china would encounter pressure from competition of personnel , competition with foreign enterprises , and employment after its entry into the wto .
he pointed out : hong kong has joined the wto for a long time . in addition , the timeliness and its favorable geographical position and support of the people all enable it to cooperate with the mainland to meet the challenges brought by china 's wto entry .
the hksar government and business circles are all familiar with the laws and regulations on international trade and have mastered the gist of the articles on the wto . they can share their relevant experience with the mainland .
many members have offered views and suggestions on how hong kong and the mainland should strengthen cooperation .
member lu tsung - lin said : the mainland and hong kong may strengthen cooperation and supplement each other with their own advantages .
after opening some relevant industries to hong kong enterprises , the mainland may absorb sufficient investment from hong kong and enable its enterprises to learn how to do business and even compete with foreign - funded enterprises and then improve their product or service quality .
deputy rita fan hsu lai - tai said such a report made by a big country is quite below the standard .
the hong kong issue mentioned in the report is completely groundless . it says hong kong is a special place for sending illegal immigrants to the united states .
in the process of interpreting the basic law , the npc standing committee respected the views of various quarters and did not interfere in the final decision made by the court of final appeal of the special administrative region .
as a matter of fact , the americans are very clear about this . however , they have deliberately used this as a pretext to attack our human rights situation and interfere in the internal affairs of another country .
the results of all opinion polls conducted in hong kong show the hong kong people support the interpretation on the basic law made by the npc standing committee .
we are very clear the united states has dual standards for china and are very clear the united states often uses the human rights issue to make things difficult for china .
beijing , 11 mar ( xinhua ) - - last year , 11 deputies from the beijing municipal people congress , including deputy zhang guochu , suggested : written replies should be given to signed letters of accusations , complaints , and appeals .
this is a living example of how beijing courts implement suggestions by people congress deputies and the masses .
since last year , beijing municipality has reaped fine social results by intensifying supervisions by people congresses on the people courts and people procuratorates , and by having judicial organs safeguard judicial impartiality through social and media supervision .
the beijing municipal people court and procuratorate set up departments and organizations that are specially responsible for handling criticism from people congress deputies and committee members of the chinese people political consultative conference [ cppcc ] .
it also specially invited national people congress [ npc ] deputies who were in beijing , and municipal people congress deputies and cppcc committee members to inspect judicial and procuratorial work , and criticize work by all levels of courts and procuratorates .
at the same time , it also seriously implemented and handled motions and suggestions put forward by people s congress deputies and cppcc committee members .
last year , the people court handled 49 motions submitted by deputies and cppcc members , and 20 opinions and suggestions submitted by specially invited supervisors .
to ensure judicial fairness , all levels of courts in beijing implemented the open trial system in 1999 , and the procuratorates implemented the open system for procuratorial matters .
in one year 's time , 100,000 people from the masses sat as visitors to directly hear trials on cases , and 4,000 reporters gathered news materials on cases tried in open courts .
to uphold judicial fairness , the judicial organs took a series of new measures to promote impartiality by being open .
the courts established and improved on the system of specially invited supervisors , system of people jurors , system of civilized law - enforcement supervisory cards , and such systems as open documents on judgments and propositions on receptions by court presidents .
the procuratorates implemented a system under which deadlines are set for making replies to reports , complaints , and appeals , and the system of supervisory cards that are clearly displayed to the masses .
at present , courts in the entire municipality have invited more than 150 social supervisors , and produced over 1,200 new people jurors .
nine procuratorates in the entire municipality established expert consultation committees , and employed 76 expert consultation and supervisory members .
the courts established the system of consultations by experts and scholars , and employed 48 considerably high - caliber experts and scholars to serve as members of the higher people court consultation committee , and to provide consultations and proofs for difficult and unprecedented cases .
to ensure that social supervision is widespread , courts and procuratorates adhered to the system of eception days for court presidents and chief procurators .
last year in the entire municipality , 83 court presidents received over 4,500 people on more than 600 occasions , and solved over 3,000 problems facing the masses , including rectifying four erroneous cases .
the complaints and appeals court of the supreme people court last year received letters and visits totaling 5,000 people ( documents ) last year , and provided solutions and answers to every case .
beijing , 11 mar ( xinhua ) - - the presidium of the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] held its second meeting on the morning of 11 march at the great hall of the people .
li peng , executive chairman of the presidium , chaired the meeting .
after putting to a vote at the meeting , the draft resolution on the government work report of the third session of the ninth npc was adopted , which will be distributed in printed form to delegates for examination and put to a vote at the general meeting .
chen guangyi , chairman of the npc financial and economic committee , delivered an examination report to the presidium on the execution of the 1999 national economic and social development plan and on the draft 2000 national economic and social development plan .
this examination report was put to a vote and adopted at the meeting , which will be distributed in printed form to all delegates following the meeting .
guo zhenqian , vice chairman of the npc financial and economic committee , made an examination report on the execution of the central and local government budgets in 1999 and on the draft 2000 central and local government budgets .
local governments ' budgets shall be compiled by localities ' various levels of people 's governments and submitted to the same level of people 's congresses for examination and approval .
the examination report will be distributed to all delegates in printed form after the meeting .
beijing , march 11 - - it is that time of the year again , when the spring breeze brings forth the green in trees , for us to be ushering in our 21st arbor day .
the vast numbers of cadres and people from all walks of life will be using their hoes and spades in the urban and rural areas to fulfill their sacred obligation as chinese citizens - - taking part in voluntary tree planting to keep the motherland green .
over the past 21 years , several billion people have taken part in voluntary tree planting activities nationwide , and more than 32 billion trees have been planted .
the acreage of our man - made forests is the largest in the world , and we have made the historic achievement of scoring continuous growth in afforested area and reserves .
a total of 50 million hectares of trees have been planted in 10 key forestry and ecology projects , and a new pattern of afforestation and ecological development has taken shape .
an ecological environment with green hills and clean rivers has now appeared in certain parts of zhejiang , fujian , guangdong , anhui and hunan , and green corridors have been built along railways , highways and rivers .
however , problems of soil erosion , desertification and frequent drought and flooding still have not been fundamentally checked . they are holding back , even threatening , economic construction and social development .
the implementation of the strategy of developing the western regions will also make the work of afforestation more important and pressing .
in order to accelerate the pace of afforestation , we need to continuously explore new mechanisms and formulate new methods and measures on the basis of effective practices of voluntary tree planting in the past , and encourage more people to take part in afforestation .
in our efforts to build " green corridors " throughout the country in recent years , we have been able to raise more than 700 million yuan without any state investment thanks to the policy of " giving forest ownership to those who built the forests . "
the measure of " offering grain in relief instead of outright grant and contracting afforestation to individual households " in returning land for farming to forestry is also a new creation in the new period .
in order to accelerate afforestation , we need to increase the intensity of scientific and technological support , and ensure that each tree planted will survive and each plot nourished will stay green .
the western parts of china have very poor natural conditions , and the restoration of vegetation is very difficult in these areas . there , afforestation will depend on the application of science and technology .
the intensive commercial forests in the eastern parts of china are even more dependent on science and technology .
in the building of ecological forests for the public good , the important thing is to tackle the issues of increasing the survival and preservation rates of forests and pastures in the arid and semi - arid areas and in river valleys that are both hot and dry .
in the building of commercial forest bases , it is necessary to address the questions of achieving rapid growth , bumper harvest , fine quality and high efficiency .
while accelerating afforestation , it is necessary to assign greater importance to forest protection .
the new " forestry law " and the " rules for the implementation of the forestry law " provide effective weapons for the protection of forests .
measures should be taken to stop despicable acts of destroying forests and land for afforestation as quickly as possible through their implementation .
it is necessary to increase investment and adopt effective measures to strengthen the prevention and treatment of forest pests and diseases in order to protect the achievements of afforestation that have not been easy to come by .
this is gratifying news .
as long as we can exert efforts together , intensify our protection of the ecological environment and persist in our endeavors at afforestation , we will definitely be able to build our motherland into a country with beautiful mountains and rivers .

beijing , 11 mar ( xinhua ) - - the spring buds are ready to burst , as beijing is filled with the mood of springtime .
the curtain has fallen on the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] .
during the eight and a half day session , more than 2,000 committee members from various nationalities and sectors freely expressed their views , sought consensus , and pursued development .
facing the new century , the committee member ' pace was still steadier and their confidence still firmer .
thousands of one heart , mind become combined force " the year 2000 marks the turn of the century , the challenges we face are unprecedented , and the opportunities we face are also without precedent . "
cppcc vice chairman ye xuanping 's words at the opening of the session resonated powerfully in the members ' minds .
everyone is agreed about that .
in the year marking the turn of the century , the broadly representative cppcc feels all the more a kind of urgency and responsibility .
as the broadest patriotic united front , the cppcc has known 50 springs and autumns , and it has formed into the broadcast patriotic united front in the new period .
the 2,000 members , divided into 48 panels , engaged in lively discussion .
the committee members held that this is an encouraging report that seeks truth from facts .
the report is shorter than before , but contains more experiences ; there is less stereotyped and empty talk , and more specialized and technical language . this fully proves that our government is pragmatic , knows the business , and has great energy .
many members also candidly put forward their views on amendments .
the party and state leaders have attached great importance to the views and suggestions of the cppcc .
the members said that this showed the importance and support given to cppcc work by the cpc central committee and state council , and embodied the democratic style of work of the third - generation leadership collective of the cpc central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core .
the ministerial seats in the great hall of the people attracted unusual attention .
solidarity and democracy , as the two main topics of the cppcc , have become still more prominent at the turn of the century .
serve overall situation , focus on central tasks a missed opportunity may never come again .
both before and during the session , the members ' common aim was to serve the overall situation , focus on the central tasks , and pursue reform and development .
before the session , the cppcc national committee organized expert members to undertake 43 studies on specific topics ; these made 37 investigation reports , 27 of which were submitted as views and suggestions to the cpc central committee and state council .
one change in this session that aroused attention was the revival of the practice of having a vice chairman deliver a report on motions at the opening gathering .
the members said that this shows that the role of motions has become still more conspicuous in the cppcc 's functions of political consultation and democratic supervision , and illustrates the great importance that the standing committee attaches to motions .
as an important channel for participating in and discussing political affairs , the cppcc members ' enthusiasm for submitting motions was very high during the session .
by 1700 on 7 march , the motions group had received a total of 3,316 motions , of which 3,061 had been put on record , the highest number ever .
a further 300 were submitted to the motions group after that deadline , related to the economy , politics , culture , and so on .
the 688 speech materials submitted at the full sessions also set a new record .
serving the overall situation by focusing on the central tasks is a basic principle in cppcc work . as a policy decision of farreaching strategic significance , the great development of west china became a focal issue for the members at this year 's session .
this topic was a category of its own in the speech materials this year , with 120 speech materials on this issue received by the speeches group , nearly one quarter of the session 's speech materials .
one of the full speechmaking sessions specifically concentrated on the great development of the west ; work personnel have told us that this was the first time that the cppcc has had a speechmaking session specifically devoted on one topic .
the members have been concerned for the hot , difficult , and crucial points in china 's onward advance .
- - " great development is not the same as large - scale reclamation of barren land or exploitation of minerals . "
wang dianzuo , president of the china engineering academy and a cppcc national committee member , thus vividly expressed the views of many cppcc members that the development of the west should proceed in parallel with ecological construction .
- - how can hi - tech industry occupy the commanding height ?
- - committee member gu wenqing said it is necessary to establish a perfect supervision mechanism in order to cure both the symptoms and the cause in opposing corruption and promoting honest government .
- - quality education must highlight the spirit of innovation and pioneering and cultivate practical ability .
this was stated by zuo tieyong , president of beijing industrial university .
they set out their views during their consultations on affairs of state .
although their viewpoints sometimes differed , all of them had the same aim : for the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation ...
facing future with full confidence the stately great hall of the people has witnessed the development and strengthening of the republic and also the trials and hardships of the cppcc .
cppcc national committee chairman li ruihuan said at the closing ceremony : " in fulfilling the tasks of reform and development and enhancing the standard of cppcc work , we must make efforts to improve our work methods and vigorously advocate going into the midst of practice . "
as they left the great hall of the people . the members felt the heavy burdens on their shoulders .
one member said , following this session , while studying assiduously , i will go deep into the grass roots and reality , put forward suggestions and views on specific topics , and continually enhance the level of setting forth my views .
one member proposed , the development of science and technology is a major issue with a bearing on the overall situation , and i will continue to investigate and study and put forward views and suggestions to the departments concerned .
the shadows of sails pass swiftly by when the wind is high . on the advance toward the new century , the cppcc with its glorious traditions is bound to create new brilliance .
this historical fact fully proves that the great unity of the chinese nation is an important prerequisite for us to accomplish the great cause of reform , opening up , and modernization .
national equality and unity constitute the important cornerstones for the continuing development and progress of the chinese nation [ subhead ] for thousands of years in old china 's history , national discrimination and disputes have hindered the progress of the chinese nation .
deputy dabeng from the nanyi lhoba autonomous township in tibet 's mainling county explained to these reporters the great significance of national unity by citing the changes in the history of the lhoba nationality .
he said : the people of lhoba nationality in nanyi still lived a primitive tribal life before the democratic reform of 1959 in tibet .
after the democratic reform , the people of the lhoba nationality , with the solicitude of the party and the government , began to move out of caves in mountains to settle down in a river valley with a smooth terrain , power stations , and highways .
lhoba people brought wasteland into cultivation and developed agriculture , animal husbandry , and sideline production according to local conditions , bringing about a tremendous change in their mode of production .
without the party 's policy toward nationalities , we lhoba people could not have become what we are today . "
under the guidance of the party central committee and its policy on regional national autonomy , the people of various natioanliteis in guangxi have built a poor and backward guangxi into a new one full of vitality and with rapid economic development , and this is the best proof .
now it is full of vigor everywhere in guangxi , and prosperity prevails throughout the native place of the zhuang nationality .
in xinjiang , a multinational region , all nationalities ' freedom of faith is respected and protected by law .
frequent economic and technological exchanges between various nationalities , which have been brought about through reform and opening up , have further strengthened the cohesion of the chinese nation and made the great unity of nationalities unbreakable .
" xinjiang is vast in area , and it has a great potential for the development of water and land resources .
when deputy yao yongfeng told these reporters about this situation , his tone was like telling a legend .
in kashi , various fresh vegetables are now available in the market all the year round .
the vegetable growers from shandong cannot leave kashi , and the people in kashi hate to part with those vegetable growers of the han nationality .
he told these reporters : in ngari prefecture now , the number of businessmen from the interior of the country is even larger than that of the prefecture 's people living in towns .
deputy legqog , also from the snow plateau of tibet said : tibet cannot develop without the support of fraternal nationalities .
sixty-two projects built with the aid of various provinces , municipalities , and ministries and commissions under the central government have all gone into operation , making it possible for tibet to take on an entirely new look .
these years , tibet and 15 provinces and municipalities , which have provide aid for tibet , have achieved very good results in association and cooperation with each other in various ways and at various levels .
since 1995 , shanghai municipality has assisted tibet in building scores of projects , including the lhasa hospital for infectious diseases , the xigaze water supply project , and the shanghai square in xigaze , expressing the shanghai people 's deep friendly feelings for the tibetan people .
now areas inhabited by minority nationalities are no longer closed to the outside world , markets in such areas have quickly become national ones , and goods made in these areas are entering markets in the interior of the country in an endless stream .
npc deputies and members of the cppcc national committee believed that the increasing economic and technological exchanges between various fraternal nationalities have promoted national economic development , brought about brisk markets , and improved the nation 's international competitiveness .
owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority - nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .
such a gap has always received the close attention of the party and the government , and the pace of narrowing the gap is being quickened at the turn of the centuries .
deputy abulahat abdurixit , chairman of the xinjiang uygur autonomous region , said : development of the western region has brought to the minority - nationality regions along the border an unprecedented , historic opportunity .
unity and stability are a prerequisite and guarantee for development and progress , and the great unity of nationalities can be strengthened and maintained only through development .
he then said in a firm stone : the tibetan people firmly oppose various attempts to split the motherland and resolutely oppose ethnic separatism .
history shows that only in the big family of the chinese nation will tibet be able to have opportunities to develop itself and to build a bright future .
based on the opinions of all of the delegations and relevant special committees , the npc finance and economic committee examined the report .
results of the committee 's examination are as follows : 1 .

( 2 ) we should take into consideration interests of all concerned and assure key expenditures .

we should properly arrange and make use of funds for supporting the great development of the western region and for improving production and living conditions of people living in poor areas .

we should sum up experience in a timely manner , improve and refine budget preparation methods , standardize departmental budgets drafting , and expand the scope of departmental budgets drafting .
we should reform the system of budgetary subjects , scientifically establish standards of fund expenditure , straighten out revenues and expenditures of budget units , and reasonably define their work and financial authority .
the above report is for your deliberation .
some people even optimistically predicted that china and the eu would conclude an agreement at the beginning of this year and china 's wto entry was just around the corner .
nevertheless , the results of the new round of consultations between china and the eu , which was held in brussels in late - january , showed that things were not so simple as imagined .
a reporter of the weekly " jingji daobao , " which just published its latest issue , dispatched back a report telling where the crux of the problem lies .
according to the report , after making an detailed analysis of the contents of the agreement reached by china and the united states , the eu stated that there was still " 20 percent of special interests " calling for negotiations with china .
the report pointed out : there is no way for the eu and china to sign an agreement at one go , and the process of negotiations will be quite difficult .
an eu official who has long engaged in china 's affairs tactfully said : judged from the technical negotiations in february , the bullish expectation to reach an agreement in the first half of this year has been diluted to a greater extent .
the impact of this incomprehensible , abnormal mentality should not be underestimated .
the report also pointed out : moreover , some eu member states are , in fact , not eager to let china enter the wto .
if china stays outside the wto a little longer , this will naturally ease the pressure on the eu for competition .
against this broad background , it is just a matter of time for the eu and china to reach an agreement in their negotiations on china 's wto entry . "
deputies from xinjiang and tibet attending the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] said that practice in xinjiang and tibet has proven that the new china 's policies on nationality and religious affairs are most successful .
deputy shadike kariaji , who is 68 years old and vice chairman of the islamic association in kashi prefecture , has been consecutively elected as an npc deputy for two terms .
he said : " the new china 's policy on nationality and religious affairs are the best .
every year when i came to attend npc session , i have engaged in worship daily and no one ever interfered with my activities . "
deputy shadike kariaji is now also a moslem mullah of the most famous kashi aitida mosque .
he said : " china has enforced a policy of religious freedom . people of various nationalities have freedom to profess a religion or not to profess a religion .
the government protects legitimate rights of all religious believers .
there are more than 20,000 [ as published ] mosques in xinjiang with some 30,000 islamic religious workers .
shadike kariaji can only speak a few chinese words .
he said : each time when i came here to attend meeting , the npc would always make arrangements to assign an uygur interpreter to accompany me in all activities .
he is now reading the " report on the work of the government " in uygur language .
shadike kariaji went on pilgrimage to mecca for three times . the most recent one was in 1999 .
he said : " now a handful of people are practicing separatism in the name of religion and sabotaging social stability . the broad masses of religious believers are firmly against such things .
only by properly implementing the party 's policy on nationality and religious affairs and uniting in a unified great family of nationalities , can xinjiang 's economy develop in a rapid way and the living standard of the people of various nationalities in xinjiang be greatly improved .
as a representative of the religious circle , i am very much concerned about the massive development in china 's western region like deputies of other nationalities .
the great strategies of developing the western region will certainly promote the progress and development of various undertakings in xinjiang .
deputy legqog , who is chairman of the tibet autonomous regional people 's government , said : in lhasa and tibet , you can see people worshipping buddha everywhere .
at present , there are more than 1,700 lamaseries and monasteries of tibetan buddhism , 300 more than in the initial period of tibet 's peaceful liberation .
tibet has included the tibetan new year and " shoton " and other tibetan festivals as holidays of the autonomous region .
legqog said : " since the beginning of reform and opening up , the state has used more than 300 million yuan and large quantities of gold and silver to repair and protect lamaseries and monasteries in tibet .
the unesco has listed the potala palace as a " world cultural heritage " . this year , tibet will continue to repair the potala palace and sajia and other temples in xigaze included in the national cultural protection list .
this is the best proof of the implementation of the party 's policies on nationality and religious affairs .
the excellent situation of unity of people of various nationalities has created favorable conditions for construction and economic development in xinjiang . after 50 years of construction , infrastructure facilities have been greatly improved in xinjiang and the comprehensive economic power has been significantly strengthened .
people of various nationalities in xinjiang have deeply felt the greatness of the party 's nationality policy .
only in the great family of nationalities of the socialist motherland , can the prospects of people of various nationalities in xinjiang be better . "

after conscientiously hearing deputies ' speeches , li peng pointed out that high attention should be paid to the resettlement of the residents in the reservoir area of the three gorges project and conscientious efforts should be made to achieve the economic restructuring .
after chairing the meeting of the presidium of the third session of the ninth npc , li peng went to the meeting hall of the chongqing delegation to attend the plenary meeting of the delegation .
the deputies of the chongqing delegation vied with one another to make speeches , thus adding vitality and warmth to the meeting atmosphere .
in line with the work report of the npc standing committee , deputies gan yuping , peng fusheng , li chengkun , sun yongfu , yao jianquan , he guoqiang , and wang yunlong , and comrade bao xuding gave speeches , in succession .
they maintained that the npc standing committee work report , concise and comprehensive , was made from a commanding height , sought truth from facts , better summed up the standing committee 's work in 1999 , and involved strong directions and instructions .
after that , li peng gave a speech at the meeting .
he said that chongqing , since its establishment as a municipality , has made rapid progress and great achievements thanks to the concerted efforts made by the broad masses of the cadres and the people in the municipality .
however , it is still confronted with some difficulties and undertakes arduous tasks in finding jobs for laid - off workers , supporting the people under the poverty line , helping ailing enterprises get out of their plight , and resettling the people living in the reservoir area .
the construction of towns for resettlement of the people now living in the reservoir area should not be done on too large a scale .
the central authorities place great hopes on chongqing municipality 's resettlement work . li peng stressed that the economic restructuring is a big task and should be achieved with conscientious efforts .
some large state - owned enterprises and war industrial enterprises in the municipality should grasp the opportunity of developing the western areas in a big way to accelerate the pace of readjusting product mix and work hard to promote technological innovation .

beijing , 11 mar ( xinhua ) - - after satisfactorily completing its agenda , the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference (cppcc) ended at the great hall of the people this afternoon .
cppcc national committee chairman li ruihuan made an important speech at the closing meeting .
the meeting was presided over by cppcc national committee vice chairman ye xuanping .
party and government leaders jiang zemin , li peng , zhu rongji , hu jintao , wei jianxing and li lanqing were seated on the rostrum .
at the beginning of the meeting , ye xuanping announced that 2,206 committee members have been invited to attend the third session of the ninth cppcc national committee and 1,907 are present .
according to the agenda and separately decided by vote , ye liansong , chen guangyuan , chen bangzhu , and zhukang tudengkezhu became additional members on the standing committee of the ninth cppcc national committee .
the correct understanding and effective use of time is of special important significance to our country , nation , cause and comrades .
he pointed out that in the course of exploring the building of socialism with chinese characteristics , comrade deng xiaoping always put the issue of time in a very important position .
it can be said that seizing the time to speed up development is an important part and striking feature of deng xiaoping theory .
at present , we are facing many knotting problems and some of them have remained unsolved over a long time . of course , these problems are complicated . however , some of them are the result of divorcing from reality , practice and the masses of people .
depending on practice and the masses of people is the most fundamental way to do all our work well , and is also the most fundamental way to discover and bring up capable personnel .
he said emphasizing practice is the basic way of thinking for the work of people 's political consultation , and is also the task and direction of endeavor of people 's political consultation .
committee members spoke highly of the new achievements in various aspects of work in our country in the past year under complicated circumstances , and put forward many opinions and proposals on promoting reform , opening up and modernization ion our country .
officials responsible for relevant departments of the cpc central committee and the state council attended the closing session as nonvoting delegates .
diplomats of various countries in china were invited to attend the closing session as observers .
the session ended amid the majestic national anthem .
this sessions has been fully successful .
this has been a session of democracy , pragmatism , unity , and motivation .
i. human society has entered 2000 ad .
at the turn of the millennium and the century , one doubly feels the rapid passing of time and the value of time by reviewing the past .
correctly understanding time and effectively utilizing time will be of great significance to our nation , our cause , and our comrades .
in 1000 ad , china was in the period of the north song dynasty and was leading the world in science and technology , in thought and culture , and in the level of productive forces .
in particular , the invention , spread , and use of paper making , gun powder , printing , and the compass became huge levers advancing changes in human society .
the west was then in the middle ages and was still stagnating in darkness .
but china failed to achieve major breakthroughs and development in those several hundred years , resulting in the weakening of the country .
to achieve national independence and liberation , the chinese people carried out arduous struggle , achieved great victories , and eventually established a new china under the leadership of the communist party of china .
in the period following the founding of the prc , the chinese people , who had become masters of their own destiny , worked extremely hard to catch up with others , producing great achievements in socialist construction .
however , a lack of experience and errors in guiding thinking led to our making detours and even such a grave mistake as the " great cultural revolution , " resulting in the loss of much valuable time .
over the past 20 years , our country has undergone very prominent changes , and our achievements have been recognized worldwide .
reviewing the splendor of the past 20 years and events of the past 1 , 000 years , one is presented with a unforgettable lesson , that is , that too much time was lost in the past .
the world today is undergoing the most rapid , extensive , and profound changes ever seen in human history .
the scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .
the trend toward globalization is accelerating ; the impact of the world market on national economies are becoming more prominent and international competition and cooperation are further deepening .
there is continual conceptual renovation ; various cultural exchanges are expanding daily ; and the notions of opening , competition , and efficiency are getting markedly stronger .
it is proper to say that as the world is getting smaller amid ever faster development , being slower by one step will lead to a difference of a thousand miles and that missing one opportunity will result in being many years behind .
from the perspective of the overall situation of development of the world , china has indeed made a lot of progress as compared with the past , but still lags significantly behind the developed countries . catching up the developed countries still represents a very difficult task .
especially , when we develop , others are developing , too , and are developing from higher starting points .
we cannot lose time any more ; time is really too urgent for us !
time and space are the basic forms of existence of matter .
time is limitless in terms of the entire material world , but is limited in terms of each particular object .
the saving and allocation of time , marx said , constitute the foremost law of economy , and all economy is , in the final analysis , economy of time .
ancient sages all attached the greatest importance to time , regarding time as speed and power and likening time to money and life ; they regarded the wasting of other people 's time as murder and regarded the wasting of one 's own time as committing slow suicide .
it is proper to say that seizing time and accelerating development are an important content and prominent characteristic of deng xiaoping theory .
the turn of the century is a very important mark of time . at this moment , it is particularly thought - provoking for us to read again comrade deng xiaoping 's remarks on time .
as far as our country and nation are concerned , time means development , future , and fate .
time is really very important for us !
the most important feature of time is its being one - dimensional .
time makes no allowance for anyone , waits for no one , and does not come back .
the two contradictory sides of an object can be transformed into each other under certain conditions , and there have been many instances of leaping development and overtaking early starters in human history .
unity and democracy are the main themes of work of the cppcc and also the basic conditions for our country 's effort to hurry up in the work of achieving development .
there will be no stability without unity , and , without unity and stability , there will be nothing to speak of .
our country is in general characterized by unity and stability .
especially , some localities are characterized by excessive numbers of furloughed workers , excessive burdens on peasants , bad public security conditions , and the occurrence of negativity and corruption despite repeated interdiction efforts ; consequently , the masses ' interests and moods have been seriously affected .
maintaining unity and stability is , in the final analysis , dependent on stability of the masses and stability of popular will .
with a desirable state of popular will , everything will be desirable ; and with stability in popular will , there will be social stability .
democracy is a goal , a means , and also a process .
without democracy , there will be no socialism and there will also be no socialist modernization .
our country is a socialist country , and the cpc 's serving as the ruling party means leading and supporting the people in their acting as masters .
without the masses ' enthusiasm and the masses ' voluntary support and proactive participation , nothing will be accomplished .
we should exploit the wisdom and potentials of the 1.2 billion people as much as possible , so as to form a great force for the rejuvenation of the chinese nation and to promote booming development of all areas of society .
the methods of combining unity with democracy , ensuring the health and order of our democratic process through having strong unity , and ensuring full vigor of our unity with full democracy represent our tradition as well as our strength which should be steadfastly maintained and applied .
it is the responsibility of the cppcc to enhance unity , to maintain stability , to apply democracy , and to advance development ; we should do a good job of discharging this responsibility .
to accomplish the task of reform and development and to improve the work of the cppcc , it is necessary to work hard to improve working methods and to vigorously advocate joining practice .
the building of socialism with chinese characteristics is an unprecedented , entirely new cause as well as the chinese people 's great practice of creating history , and will not be successful without practice of the masses of the people .
historical experience is important ; foreign experience is important ; and book knowledge is important . but , all such indirect experience will be of practical significance only by being combined with contemporary reality and being embodied by direct experience .
relying on practice and the masses will be the most basic method to ensure successful work in all areas and also constitutes the most fundamental way to discover and create qualified personnel .
the principle of practice is the first and basic principle of marxist epistemology .
as fully demonstrated by history , whenever this principle is adhered to , our cause will develop successfully ; otherwise , our cause will suffer setbacks .
joining practice is an important component of work of the cppcc .
over the past years , our emphasis on exploration in practice , conducting summing up in practice , resolving problems through practice , and using practice to advance work has played a good role in the development of the cppcc .
emphasizing practice is the basic line of thought regarding the cppcc 's work , and is also a topic facing the cppcc as well as the direction of the cppcc 's efforts .
such insufficiencies have been caused by problems of understanding and capability , but the most fundamental issue is that of practice .
members and comrades : this session of the cppcc is a session of the turn of the millennium and the turn of the century .
it is a rare opportunity for one to experience two millenniums and two centuries . it is truly excellent that a session of the cppcc can be held at this moment to perform the heavy tasks of taking part in and discussing government affairs .
a solemn sense of historical responsibility is stimulating us : do not fail to live up to the people 's weighty trust ; do not waste the good opportunity !
now i declare the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference closed .
hong kong , 11 mar (zts) - - tung chee - hwa , chief executive of the hong kong special administrative region , met in his office today with visiting us defense secretary william cohen .
tung chee - hwa briefed cohen on the successful implementation of the " one country , two systems " principle in hong kong . he also said hong kong has overcome the difficulty brought by the financial storm in asia and economic growth has resumed .
tung chee - hwa also mentioned the business opportunity to be brought by china 's joining the world trade organization .
tung chee - hwa said that the arrangements for us warships and military planes to vacation in hong kong have been resumed .
he said this kind of visits will benefit hong kong 's economy .
in accordance with the " regulations on the handling of cppcc national committee proposals , " the subcommittee for handling proposals examined the proposals it received and put 3,061 proposals on file , accounting for 92.3 percent of the total .
another 255 proposals that had not been put on file were taken as committee members ' letters to be forwarded to relevant departments for study and handling .
the strategy for the extensive development of the western region , agriculture and rural work , reform and a turnaround in state enterprises , education reform , anticorruption efforts , the building of a legal system , and the motherland 's reunification are of particular concern to committee members .
certain issues raised in proposals that urgently needed to be handled during the session have been promptly referred to relevant departments .
the subcommittee for handling proposals will promptly examine the proposals received after the deadline and place them on file , to be referred to relevant units for handling .
state planning commission minister zeng peiyan listed the work of protecting the environment in the state sustainable development strategy .
the npc deputies and cppcc [ chinese people 's political consultative conference ] national committee members also one after another put forth views on intensifying environmental protection and proposals on enacting environmental protection laws .
this shows that along with china 's fast - paced economic development , environmental sabotage and pollution have been worsening with each passing day , and it brooks no delay to step up the work of protecting the environment .
however , environmental protection has still fallen behind environmental sabotage and pollution in terms of speed .
experts estimated that direct economic losses caused by atmospheric or river environmental pollution have taken up 4 - 8 percent of the gnp [ gross national product ] , reaching approximately between 320 billion yuan and 640 billion yuan .
environmental pollution and ecological sabotage have turned into a major factor which has harmed the people 's health and restricted economic and social development .
we must step up planning and policy guidance for this work ; respect the farmers ' will ; make a success of experiments in selected areas ; and gradually popularize experiences .
we must resolutely put an end to new land reclamation that would destroy forests and grassland .
apart from expressing support for the government efforts of stepping up environmental protection , the deputies and members attending the " two sessions " also put forward quite a few proposals on how to protect the environment .
sun zhigang , npc deputy and secretary of the yichang city cpc committee , pointed out : the changjiang valley is china 's economic center . to enact laws to protect the ecological environment of the changjiang valley is a need of the state sustainable development strategy .
tian junliang , cppcc national committee member and vice president of northwest university of agricultural and forestry science and technology , said : protecting the ecological environment is a major subject to be solved in the large - scale development of the western regions .
the original article four of general work principles and other articles that follow shall become the articles that follow in order . 4 .

beijing , 11 mar ( xinhua ) - - after completing various agenda , the third session of the ninth chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] closed in beijing on 11 march .
we want to warmly congratulate the successful conclusion of the meeting !
this has been a democratic , pragmatic , united , and inspiring meeting , which made due contribution to the comprehensive fulfillment of the goals set by the party and by the state for this year and to the promotion of the magnificent cause of socialist modernization construction .
cppcc members have demonstrated strong awareness to participate in and discuss politics as well as better capability to involve in politics .
cppcc has traversed 50 years of glorious road .
as a patriotic united front organization with widest social contacts , cppcc shoulders a glorious historical mission in realizing socialist modernization , maintaining the great cause of the motherland 's reunification , and in promoting the great unity of the people of various nationalities .
standardizing legislative activities , safeguarding the unity of the legal system [ subhead ] a reporter asked : since the drive for reform and opening up to the outside world was launched , tremendous advances have been made in china 's legislative work .
why did this legal phenomenon occur in which legislative activities came first , followed by their standardization ?
qiao xiaoyang said : there have always been clear standardization stipulations concerning legislative activities .
the draft legislation law , which the current session is examining , was worked out in accordance with the constitution and the stipulations of the laws mentioned above , and on the basis of the summarization of legislative practice over the last 20 years of reform and opening up .
through examination , specialized committees are entitled to make a report to the npc standing committee if they find regulations contradict the constitution and laws .
the npc standing committee has the right to change or forsake any regulations that contradict the constitution and laws .
in reply to a reporter 's question whether the draft legislation law is also applicable to military regulations , qiao xiaoyang said : in the draft legislation law there are stipulations on military regulations . this shows that military regulations are part of our country 's legal system .
military regulations that involve local authorities are , in general , issued jointly by the state council and the central military commission . this means that such military regulations belong to administrative regulations to which the provisions of the draft legislation 's administrative regulations chapter are applicable .
china already has civil laws , such as the general rules of the civil law , contract law , warranty law , patent law , trademark law , copyright law , and marriage law .
the purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single - item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .
moreover , the formulation of such a civil code will also help promote the formation of a socialist legal system with chinese characteristics .
he said : generally speaking , a relatively perfect legal system should include the constitution , a criminal law , criminal procedure law , administrative law , administrative procedure law , civil law , and a civil action law .
qiao xiaoyang said : none of the prohibited deeds mentioned above is allowed in any country and region in the world by law , and a similar law existed before hong kong was returned to china .
he said : " according to the basic law , the hksar must enact a law on the above - mentioned issues because this belongs to the implementation of the basic law .
but legislation takes time ; and it is up to the hksar to decide when to enact . but it won 't do not to legislate . "
amending marriage law and maintaining an equal , harmonious , and civilized marriage and family relationship [ subhead ] hu kangsheng answered a reporter 's question on amendment to the marriage law .
he said : amending the marriage law has been put on the npc standing committee 's legislative agenda this year .
qiao xiaoyang and hu kangsheng also answered other questions raised by the chinese and foreign reporters at the news conference which was presided over by zhou chengkui , deputy secretary general of the npc standing committee .
haikou , 11 mar (zxs) - - cadres and the masses of people in hainan province were elated and inspired by general secretary jiang zemin 's speech delivered at the discussion meeting with hainan 's delegation at the third session of the ninth national people 's congress .
all departments directly under the hainan provincial government conscientiously studied jiang zemin 's important speech and expressed their determination to build hainan province into a still better place in line with the development orientation defined by the general secretary .
lai qinwei , director of the hainan provincial foreign economic and trade department , said : hainan will have a brilliant future in its foreign economic and trade work as long as it follows the road chartered by general secretary jiang zemin .
he said : during the early period of the founding of this province , the local products produced by hainan province only accounted for 10 percent of its total exports , and now this ratio has risen to 50 percent .
zhai peiji , director of the hainan provincial auditing department , said : in his speech , general secretary jiang zemin fully affirmed hainan 's efforts to regard tropical and highly efficient farming , and building of ecological environment as two major pillars for economic development .
haikou city held its enlarged standing committee meeting of the city party committee on 9 march to relay and study the spirit of general secretary jiang zemin .
we should formulate specific measures for implementing the spirit of general secretary 's speech , and develop haikou 's economic construction and spiritual civilization in a more coordinated manner .
after the issuance of general secretary jiang zemin 's speech , sanya city party committee immediately held an enlarged standing committee meeting to study measures for implementation .
they held that since sanya boasts richer tropical resources , it should be in the front rank of the province in the development of tropical and highly efficient farming and ecology .
the meeting proposed efforts be made this year to energetically adjust and optimize the economic structure with priority given to the development of holiday and ecological sightseeing , and really turn the rich tropical resources and good ecological farming into the advantages of sanya 's economic development .
the amended " cppcc committee constitution " will go into force as of today .
handling cases in strict accordance with the law and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the citizens is part and parcel of judicial impartiality .
according to statistics , last year people 's courts across the country directly acquitted 3,403 defendants according to the law due to a lack of evidence and 2,475 defendants because their cases had not formed a crime .
the above - mentioned statistics show that judicial organs at all levels stepped up their efforts to correct the acts of abusing judicial and administrative powers and people 's court enforced the law impartially rather than perverting it and letting criminals go unpunished .
they punished criminals according to the law while placing stress on saving those who took a wrong step in life , protecting those who acted according to the law , and supporting the reformers .
tang yinlong said zhao yanhong purposely did not take her us passport with her to cover up her real identity and disguised herself as a chinese citizen .
the public security departments ' decision on her criminal detention was entirely legal and they only performed normal official duties .
that zhao yanhong has taken such inglorious means to boost the arrogance of " falungong " can explain nothing other than showing her own immorality and the features of the " falungong " cult .
when the public security departments found zhao yanhong was an american citizen , they immediately and officially notified the us embassy in china and asked the embassy to provide information about zhao 's passport and to confirm her identity .
after zhao 's passport was received , zhao was released from criminal detention .
after learning zhao would soon be repatriated , no official of the us embassy went to see zhao .
at noon on 12 february , zhao was repatriated .
the spokesman also pointed out that after returning to the united states , zhao lied that while she was detained , she was " cuffed and kicked , was not allowed to take a bath , and was maltreated . "
as a matter of fact , the detention center zhao was in is strictly managed according to standards and no detainee has ever been cursed or maltreated .
china also tried to persuade zhao to get a lawyer on its own initiative , but this was rejected .
after zhao returned to the united states , zhao herself also said on different occasions that she had never been beaten , and took a bath on three occasions according to regulations , and that the so - called maltreatment is mere fabrication .
it expresses its gratitude to all units that undertake the handling of national cppcc committee motions for supporting cppcc work .
it asks the standing committee to focus earnestly on work concerning motions , and to fully enhance the roles of motions in fulfilling cppcc functions .
these facts show that attention and strong leadership by party and government leading departments guarantees the prosperity of model streets of the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity .
arduous and meticulous ideological and political work as well as strict management is another important experience learned at hunan road .
some are state - owned and some collectively owned .
there are also foreign - funded and sole proprietorships .
they are different in terms of class , quality , trade , and efficiency .
the full text of the article is as follows : as a mortal , people sometimes fall sick . no one can guarantee that he is always healthy and free from illness .
when a person is in poor health , he needs to see the doctor at the hospital . one can only resume healthy condition with the help of medical expertise and proper medication .
modern people are lucky to have advanced medical service , which ancient people would have envied .
since it was beyond their understanding why they got sick , they certainly did not know how to cure their illness with the right kind of medicine .
in his poem , du fu said : " it has been rare since the ancient times that a man can live until 70 years old . "
but it is now a common thing that a person can live until 70 years old or older . the extension of the average life span is exactly the result and hallmark of the achievements of science and technology .
it stands to reason that scientific and technological progress will inevitably bring about the changes of ideological concept . in fact , this case is also true .
now even a peasant woman who has a low educational level and lives in remote area will bring her sick child to the doctor if conditions permit . she will not seek help from a " fairy . "
the force of civilization has helped people to form a rational habit and respect science and civilization . but people sometimes also have some sort of " wishful thinking . " without knowing it , they will deviate from their habitual course or even go astray .
several years ago , there emerged so - called " falungong . " it seems that it has great powers . so long as a " falungong " practitioner sincerely believes in it and persists in practicing it , it will help him cure any disease .
it is common sense that if a quack doctor running around and boasting that his secret medicine will cure all kinds of diseases , people will not trust him . they will even ridicule him for his bragging . but " falungong " has confused many people .
they not only believe in it but also have great faith in it . it seems that it has some kind of " magic " power , which can defy the law of nature .
but what kind of " magic " power does " falungong " have in controlling people ?
as a matter of fact , there is no " magic " if we see it through .
with the improvement of the living standard , it is only natural that people wish to live longer . it is said that so long as people learn " falungong , " it will help cure all kinds of diseases and improve people 's health condition .
" falungong " represents a brilliant idea , that is , it will satisfy people 's wishes . people sometimes are hoodwinked by their own goodwill .
therefore , it seems that " falungong , " which is able to manipulate the weakness of human nature , has an " unimaginable " power .
another " magic " point about " falungong " lies in this fact : it claims that so long as you practices it , you can cure your disease at no cost .
if so , it will be the greatest thing in the whole world . hospitals will be closed and doctors will have to find some other jobs . the whole world should thank " falungong " for its benefits .
but such a wonderful thing did not , does not , and will not happen .
what are the achievements of " falungong " in curing and healing people ? many cases show that people have incurred diseases , become disabled , or even died . the families of victims can provide many evidences to show how tragic their cases are .
their accusations alone can prove that it is a big lie to say that " falungong " can cure diseases " at no cost . "
" master " li hongzhi , the " savior , " said : if you want to learn the great law , you have to do some reading , you have to watch video and audio tapes .
therefore , " falungong " organizations have continuously " introduced " a large amount of books , audio - video tapes , vcd , clothes and cushions for practicing " falungong , " and statues of master li .
in master li 's own words , " you get what you paid for . " many practitioners pay a little sum of money , which becomes a large sum for master li . as a result , master li 's wallet has become fatter and fatter .
otherwise , how come master li is able to have cars , big houses , and fly from one place to another place ?
the essence of superstition lies in following someone else like sheep .
that 's why " falungong " particularly stresses the importance of " sincerity . "
the idea that " sincerity works wonder " represents the essence of all forms of superstition .
therefore , li hongzhi repeatedly said in his preaching : " if practitioners take medicine to cure their diseases , it proves that they do not believe in the curing power of 'falungong ' . "
his remarks also mean that " falungong " practitioners can cure their diseases only when they do not take medicine and therefore they should not be allowed to take medicine .
here is a trick : if your disease is cured , it is because you are " sincere . " if you have not recovered from your disease , it means you are not " sincere " enough .
you should not have an iota of doubt about " falungong . " if you have any doubt about it , then you are not " sincere . " the only thing you can do is absolutely obey it and absolutely believe in it .
all in all , he is always right and you are always wrong .
even a normal person will become ill if he is spiritually fettered by such a fallacy .
medical exports said : " falungong " practitioners tend to have some kind of illusion . such an illusion will lead to mental disorder , which in turn , results in such tragedies as injuring oneself and harming others .
to get rid of the spiritual fetter of " falungong , " one should first of all overcome the superstition of " sincerity " and examine the stupid superstition with a scientific viewpoint .
if you are sick , go see the doctor . although this is just common sense , it implies a plain and scientific truth .
comrade deng xiaoping was right when he said : " marxism is a very plain thing because it has a very plain truth . "
any theory that pretends to be very abstruse and mystic is always a fallacy that serves to perplex the people .
it was an appeal recently issued by general secretary jiang zemin .
when we think of making further progress after attaining prosperity , we will be ready to welcome new challenges , to set up new goals , and to seize new opportunities .
citing their personal experiences and changes in a province or a city and through theoretical perspectives , npc deputies and cppcc committee members respectively and individually reflected glories of the times and china 's accomplishments in reform and opening up to the outside world as various droplets of water .
the 900 million peasants are the biggest beneficiaries of china 's reform and opening up to the outside world .
deputy zhang leling said : during the 50 years since new china 's establishment , chinese peasants ' incomes rose nearly 40 times . the increase occurred mainly during the past 20 years since china carried out reform and opening up to the outside world .
china 's east regions could develop earlier than other parts because of its coastal opening - up policy .
we are shouldering heavy duties and responsibilities . "
we think of the source because we aim to make further progress .
only by thinking of the source can we aim to make further progress .
while fully reaffirming china 's enormous accomplishments since it carried out reform and opening up to the outside world , npc deputies and cppcc committee members also soberly envisioned china 's existing economic and social problems .
china has attained decisive breakthroughs in restructuring its state enterprise . however , they still yield economic benefits inadequately and many deep - seated problems remain .
cppcc committee member cheng lianchang said : most state enterprises have a relatively low ratio of investment over productivity , their efficiency indices are poor , and their competitiveness is low . we would need to face these problems for a long time .
china 's agricultural sector has attained bumper harvests for several consecutive years . however , the growth rate of peasants ' incomes has slowed down .
deputy xu weiguo said : neither east nor west regions of china can avoid the challenge of strategically restructuring the agricultural sector .
after returning from his investigations , cppcc committee member wang senhao discovered : there are 6.71 million poor people in qinghai , yunnan , and guizhou provinces .
we must deepen reform and expeditiously develop to resolve problems which have popped up while china is carrying reform and opening up to the outside world .
if we are complacent and do not intend to forge ahead , the gap between china and developed countries will widen .
the only way out is to continually redouble our efforts and work attentively and diligently .
this was the consensus reached by the deputies and committee members .
china which carried reform and opening up has eliminated old and obsolete rules and customs . it is sparkling with vitality and vigor . in their discussions , the deputies and committee members have expressed their firm convictions to continually forge ahead .
to think of making further progress after attaining prosperity , we should eliminate our sense of contentment , operate large undertakings , pursue major development , strive to make advancement , and continually explore in a pioneering spirit .
deputies from china 's east regions are enthusiastic and very confident and ambitious .
deputies from china 's west regions did not back down either .
thinking of making further progress is an requirement for facilitating the great cause of rejuvenating the chinese nation .
by thinking of the source while striving to attain prosperity , we have reaffirmed our path and direction for attaining victory , consolidated our confidence , and enhanced our strength .
we have invigorated the spirit gearing toward the future , rallied the will to welcome challenges , gathered the wisdom to overcome difficulties , and radiated a vitality for continually facilitating renovation .

beijing , 12 mar ( xinhua ) - - the central forum on population , resources , and environment was held this morning at the great hall of the people .
jiang zemin , general secretary of the cpc central committee , and president of the state presided over the forum and delivered an important speech .
he stressed : successfully carrying out family planning , resources management and environmental protection work is of great overall significance in realizing the grand objective of china 's cross - century development .
in the course of reform , opening up and socialist modernization drive , we must always closely integrate economic development with the work on population , resources and environment , make overall planning and arrangements , and carry the work in a coordinated manner .
party and state leaders , including li peng , zhu rongji , li ruihuan , hu jintao , wei jianxing , and li lanqing , attended the forum .
this is one of the arduous and important tasks which face the comrades of the whole party and the people throughout the country .
jiang zemin pointed out : china is a developing country which is most densely populated in the world . its average per - capita resources is very limited . so we must always attach strategic importance to controlling population , economizing resources and protecting the environment .
only thus , can we realize the sustainable development .
during the 21st century , we should continue to exert efforts to grasp the work of keeping a low birth rate , and rationally using and strictly managing resources in order to protect and create a good ecological environment .
the whole party and the whole nation from the leadership to the masses should be determined to realize the established population , resources and environment objectives so as to guarantee the realization of the grand objective of china 's cross - century development .
jiang zemin said : in the new century , it is necessary to conscientiously and comprehensively implement the party central committee and the state council 's " decision on strengthening population and family planning work and keeping a stable low - birth rate . "
comprehensive measures should be further adopted and a perfect regulation and control system should be established in an effort to keep a stable low - birth rate .
we should implement the strictest resources management system and persist in not wavering in the general principle of " seeking development in the course of protection and giving protection in the course of exploitation . "
it is necessary to strive to enhance the utilization and efficiency of resources and find an economic development road which can economizes resources .
jiang zemin said : implementing the strategy of extensively developing the western region and promoting the accelerated development of the central and western regions is one of the party central committee and the state council 's major policy decisions affecting the overall situation of china 's modernization drive .
to successfully implement the strategy of extensively developing the western region , we must realize a benign cycle in population , resources and environment .
to properly handle the relationship between economic development and population control , we must develop the economy , control population and enhance the population quality .
the western region boasts rich resources . to change the resources advantages into economic advantages , we must uphold the principle of rationally using and economizing resources .
we must make earnest efforts to avoid following the old track of carrying out improvement and restoration efforts before pollution and damages are seen .
jiang zemin noted : during this new century , we should strengthen , not weaken , the work on population , resources and environment in china .
party committees and governments at all levels should realistically strengthen and improve leadership over the work on population , resources , and environment , and firmly implement it with consistent efforts until actual results are achieved .
family planning , resources prospecting and management , and environmental protection work are public welfare undertakings having obvious social efficiency . all localities should act in line with the central demands , and ensure that the investments in these fields are in place .
it is necessary to boost the enthusiasm of all sectors and establish an investment mechanism with a great diversity of investors and multiple channels .
we should strengthen the building of ranks of workers to take charge of the work on population , resources and environment , and strive to raise the quality of the work on population , resources and environment in the grass roots .
the party and government principal leaders should coordinate the work and organize the efforts of all sectors to comprehensively tackle the population , resources and environmental problems .
departments in charge of the administrative work on population , resources and environment should supervise and manage this work in a unified manner and in line with law , and raise the results of law enforcement .
violations of the law should be called to account in line with law and those acts that constitute a crime should be punished and dealt with according to law .
the party committees and governments at all levels should manage things strictly in line with the law , policies and plans .
party - member cadres , especially leading cadres , should serve as examples in carrying out family planning as well as in protecting resources and environment .
we should uphold the operating principle of believing in , relying on , respecting and serving the masses .
in doing our work , we must guard against bureaucracy , dogmatism , and formalism .
mass organizations such as the trade union , communist youth league , women 's federation , and family planning association should give full play to their role , and jointly promote the work on population , resources , and environment .
the whole party and the whole nation from leadership to the masses should redouble their efforts , guarantee the smooth realization of the targets for the work on population , resources and environment in china in the new century , and bring better benefits to the chinese nation .
premier zhu rongji gave a speech at the forum on how to study and implement the spirit of general secretary jiang zemin 's speech and to successfully carry out the work on family planning , resources management and environmental protection .
sun ying , secretary of the gansu provincial party committee , lu ruihua , governor of guangdong province , liu qi , mayor of beijing municipality , and li chunting , governor of shandong province , took the floor one after another .
also attending the forum were central leading comrades , including ding guangen , li changchun , wu guanzheng , jiang chunyun , jia qinglin , huang ju , wen jiabao , zeng qinghong , peng peiyun , and wang zhongyu .
principal responsible comrades of the party committees and governments of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities , and responsible comrades of relevant departments of the central and state organs , and of the liberation army and the armed police forces also attended the forum .
this may be considered the " best gift " which the new millennium or the new century gives to xinjiang .
abulahat abdurixit , deputy to the national people 's congress session and chairman of the xinjiang uygur autonomous regional government , is always full of confidence while talking about the issue on the great development of xinjiang .
abulahat maintained that xinjiang has possessed good conditions to welcome the great development of the western region , as well as itself .
as everyone knows , xinjiang has rich water , land , solar energy , thermal power , mineral , and tourist resources . with distinctive features and good conditions for combination of such resources , xinjiang has giant potential and vast prospects for development .
xinjiang serves as a bridgehead opening china to the west . the countries in central asia have provided xinjiang with great chances for expanding itself wider to the west .
xinjiang at present has a good foundation for developing its economy on a large scale .
on the specific measures for large - scale development , chairman abulahat has clear ideas as if enumerating his family treasures .
he maintained that speeding up the construction of infrastructure facilities is the foundation for great development .
although xinjiang has made great headway in the construction of infrastructure facilities , it still has a long way to go in order to catch up with the national average levels and the eastern coastal areas .
in particular , xinjiang 's water conservancy and transportation conditions are in urgent need of improvement .
it is imperative to improve the functions of urumqi and kashi airports and to start , as quickly as possible , the expansion of hetian and karamay airports .
the construction of the " information expressway " will be facilitated .
it is necessary to build long petroleum pipelines between xinjiang and lanzhou and the key project of sending natural gas from " western china east " to shanghai .
water conservancy projects are of great momentum , too .
water conservancy projects will be developed with the focus on developing and harnessing three major rivers , namely ili he , ertix he , and tarim he .
at the same time , ground water should vigorously be developed and utilized ; and high - quality , water - saving irrigation projects should be developed on a large scale , so as to eliminate the influence by floods and drought .
abulahat maintained that acceleration of ecological protection and construction is the focus of large - scale development .
xinjiang will improve the ecological environment by returning grain plots to forestry , closing hillsides to facilitate afforestation , planting trees , and growing grasses .
according to reports , xinjiang has planned to return three million mu of farmland to forestry in the next three years .
the region arranges a project of diverting water from the north to the south , plans to build water conservancy projects and improve river courses to protect and build the ecological environment along tarim he and to further bring the ever - worsening ecological environment under control .
efforts should be made to comprehensively prevent the southern edges of tarim and junggar basins from desertification .
it is imperative to strengthen the environmental protection and improvement of bosten hu , the largest inland fresh water lake in china ; and ebinur hu , that is going to dry up .
meanwhile , efforts should be made to quicken the pace of comprehensively improving the environment of urumqi , known as a polluted city in china .
according to reports , the state and localities will invest more than 100 billion yuan in the above projects .
abulahat said that actively readjusting the industrial structure is the key to implementing the strategy of great development .
to readjust the current unreasonable industrial structure , xinjiang should first devote its main efforts to developing agriculture with special features .
through the efforts in the next two or three years , xinjiang , as the largest cotton production base in china , should reduce its cotton sown areas by a big margin , with its total cotton output still remaining at the 1999 level of over 1.35 million tonnes .
actively in response to the state strategic shift of petroleum and natural gas industries , xinjiang should build itself into the country 's largest petroleum and natural gas industrial base and a key petrochemical industrial base in west china and cultivate tourism into a new important economic growth point .
abulahat finally indicated that forcefully developing science and technology and education is a key condition and guarantee for large - scale development .
to this end , he stressed the need to help the poverty - stricken areas vigorously develop education , strengthen the training of officials and the cultivation of talented persons of minority nationalities , and work out preferential policies to attract talented persons at home .
during and after the second session of the ninth cppcc national committee , various democratic parties , the people 's organizations concerned , and the cppcc members put forth a total of 3,341 motions .
in accordance with the relevant stipulations of " the regulations of the cppcc national committee on motions work , " the motions committee examined the motions it had received ; registered some 3,118 motions ; and handled some 223 motions as the members ' letters .
some 1,756 members had put forth motions , accounting for 79.5 percent of the entire membership . the eight democratic parties had put forth some 63 motions while the members ' groups had put forth some 26 motions .
the motions committee also examined and processed in a timely fashion the motions it had received after the session wound up .
by 20 february, 2000 , some 3,004 motions had been handled or answered , accounting for 96.3 percent of the total , while some 2,542 opinions and proposals had been handled or listed in the handling plan , accounting for 84.6 percent of the total .
by seeking truth from facts , the relevant units also gave explanations regarding the motions that had not been handled due to circumstances at the time .
the members also gave feedback for some 976 motions which had been handled and some 95.4 percent of them said that they were satisfied or basically satisfied with the way the motions had been handled . 1 .
after receiving these opinions and proposals , the relevant units conscientiously studied and handled them ; accepted many of them ; or referred to them while formulating policies or improving their work .
the motions have played an important role in helping cppcc perform its functions and furthering all types of work for national economic and social development .
the motions about economic construction accounted for some 42.9 percent of the total , covering a wide range of sectors .
last may , led by vice chairman sun fuling , the members of the motions committee joined hands with the state economic and trade commission in conducting investigations and study and jointly submitted an investigation and study report to the cpc central committee and the state council .
both premier zhu rongji and vice premier wu bangguo issued important instructions on the report .
on the basis of their previous motions , some parties and members again suggested that a system for bank savings deposit holders to use their real names be introduced and people 's bank of china decided to incorporate this proposal when drafting the relevant plans or regulations .
as for the motion on further lowering the electricity fees in urban and rural areas , the state planning commission incorporated this view in its " opinions on implementing the reform of the policy of charging electricity fees with both principal and interest . "
national rejuvenation through science and education and spiritual civilization building are also the key contents of the motions .
the ministry of education issued an emergency circular the other day , providing specific regulations to this end .
the motions put forth by some members on heightening vigilance against evil religious activities and maintaining social stability and security reflected the aspirations of the broad masses of the people .
vice premier li lanqing wrote the following instruction on the report : " please assemble and sort out the opinions on this issue and study them together after the committee for the aged is established . "
now that the national work committee for the aged has been established , the country 's 10th five - year development plan is expected to incorporate the proposals provided for in the investigation and study report as a key content .
the party and government departments have attached great importance to the cppcc motions and many leaders have personally made arrangements for or handled those motions , thus intensifying the motion handling work ; helping establish and perfect a motion handling system ; and guaranteeing the motion implementation .
in order to further raise the motions work quality , the standing committee of the cppcc national committee has conducted positive explorations and practice since the second session of the ninth cppcc national committee .
( 1 ) in order to make the work on motions meet the demand of the situation development , the cppcc national committee held its fourth forum on work on motions in beijing in november, 1999 .
after the forum , the general office of the cppcc national committee printed and transmitted the forum documents to all the cppcc committees at local levels and the relevant units and this has helped push forward the continued development of the motions work .
the motions committee also stepped up propaganda on the motions work ; publicized the significance and role of the cppcc motions work through the news media ; and held news briefings to report on the situation of handling important motions . 3 .
since the second session of the ninth cppcc national committee , the motions work has made significant headway but has still fallen far behind the situation development and the demand of the cppcc work .
first , the motion quality has to be raised further .
the motions are the basis of the motions work .
though there are quite a few high - quality motions at the moment , the general standard has to be raised further .
lacking in investigations and study , some motions have contained relatively empty contents or proposals that are too general and hard to implement and this has impaired the effect of the motions ; second , some handling units have failed to fully understand or effectively conduct the handling work .
some members reported that certain units had handled motions in a formalistic way or failed to answer questions to the point ; third , the motions committee has to further improve its service work .
this year marks the turn of the century .
xu kuangdi said : shanghai is china 's financial , industrial , commercial and trade , and shipping center , a large number of its industries have intergrated with the international economy ahead of others , and its foreign trade growth ranks first in the country .
shanghai definitely will be deeply influenced by " wto entry , " but , in general , there will be more advantages than disadvantages .
xu kuangdi said that shanghai had begun preparing for " wto entry " three years ago , and whether it could achieve success in coping with " wto entry " would provide experience to other places of china .
the pillar industries , such as telecommunications , computers , car - making , and medical industries , established over the past two decades will be the second to be influenced .
these industries require large amounts of investment , their technological level is high , and most of them are joint ventures , but their production scale is small , and it is difficult for them to compete with their foreign counterparts .
shanghai has worked out plans , preparing to integrate these industries with the international economy , including preparing to purchase spare parts from the international market .
service industries , including financial , insurance , postal and telecommunications services , are the third to be influenced .
shanghai has sent a large number of selected young people to receive training in the united states and europe .
when foreign capital enters on a large scale , shanghai will be able to guarantee its competitive edges and establish joint ventures smoothly with foreign firms .
xu kuangdi said : shanghai has accelerated reform of state - owned enterprises to enable them to establish joint ventures with the multinationals in the world .
shanghai 's industries have absorbed more than $ 30 billion foreign capital and established more than 28,000 foreign - funded enterprises .
xu kuangdi said : to meet the international competition , shanghai has established one economic development zone in latin america and another in africa . discussion is underway on building an industrial zone in central asia in order to expand the market in east europe .
it is working on the project of connecting the internet , the post and telecommunications network , and the cable television network , which is the first such project in china and which will lay a foundation for competition when foreign capital enters shanghai on a large scale .
the deputies pointed out that it is necessary to promote reform and development while maintaining social stability and maintain social stability in the course of reform and development .
reform and development can only be properly achieved in a stable social environment .
reform is the motive force of development , and is the only way toward modernization ; stability is the basic precondition of reform and development , because without stability we cannot accomplish anything ; hence we should handle the relations of the three aspects appropriately .
the key to seizing the opportunity lies in the proper handling of the relations between stability , reform , and development .
deputy li jiating pointed out that the idea of development being an absolute principle put forward by comrade deng xiaoping is of momentous significance to china at the turn of the centuries .
after 50 years of development , china has made considerable headway in various aspects . in the new millennium , we must seek unity of thinking and regard development as the crucial point for the solution of the problems that we are confronted with .
under the new situation , we must more soberly handle the relations between stability , reform , and development , as the negligence in any aspect will bring adverse impacts to the economic and social development .
talking about the correct handling of the relations between stability , reform , and development , some deputies stressed the importance of instituting a social security system .
of course , this problem should be ultimately resolved through development .
deputy dong wande from liaoning said : as the issue of social security has a bearing on the process of social stability and enterprise reform , we must have a good grasp of this important matter from the high plane of reform , development , and stability .
deputy zhang dongsheng said : when a major reform measure is introduced , we must fully consider the tolerance level in society , and the interests of the broad masses in particular .
otherwise , the reform will lack mass foundation and trigger destabilizing factors , for which we must pay an enormous price .
stability is the precondition of development , and unity is the foundation for stability .
he said that the development of a locality hinges on a benign cycle constituted by stability , reform , and development .
deputy shen lianbin from shanxi proposed that to maintain social stability , it is necessary to start with the following five tasks : 1 ) continuing to push forward the reform of economic and political structures and seeking stability through in - depth reform .
2 ) vigorously promoting economic construction and seeking stability through accelerated development .
3 ) bringing the economic environment under control in accordance with the law , cracking down on various activities of economic crime and criminal offense , and seeking stability through intensified building of the legal system .
4 ) studying and exploring new ideas , new methods , and new approaches for ideological and political work under the new situation , and seeking stability through exploiting the political advantages of the party .
5 ) conscientiously carrying out the " decisions on further intensifying the building of the contingent of political and legal cadres , " and seeking stability through the self - building of the contingent of political and legal personnel .
agriculture is an important condition for the stability of a country .
deputy wang ping is of the opinion that in order to stabilize and intensify the position of agriculture as a foundation , the urgent tasks at the moment are to increase peasants ' incomes and open up rural markets .
at present , the principal problem that affects the increase of peasants ' incomes is the irrational structure in stages , which must be reasonably adjusted by facing the markets .
another principal problem is peasants ' excessively heavy burdens . if this problem is not properly settled , it will directly endanger social stability and development .
second , we should strictly carry out the state 's stipulations and take positive and effective measures to guard against arbitrary charges imposed on peasants .
the extent of close relations between cadres and masses has a bearing on rural stability .
moreover , they should concentrate their efforts on the two major issues of developing the economy and lightening the burdens of the peasants while increasing their incomes .
looking forward to the future , the deputies are full of confidence .
the chinese party , government , and military leaders recently made consistent remarks over the taiwan issue .
zhang wannian , vice chairman of the central military commission , stressed that declaration of taiwan independence will mean war .
li peng , chairman of the national people 's congress [ npc ] , said that zhang wannian 's remark represents the cpc central committee 's policy toward taiwan .
a source in beijing revealed that the recent remarks on the taiwan issue made by the chinese party , government , and military leaders were in line with the spirit of a resolution on the taiwan issue adopted by the cpc central committee political bureau .
in mid - february , the cpc central committee political bureau adopted the resolution no. 9 of 2000 on the taiwan issue .
the " one - china principle and the taiwan issue " white paper published by the state council taiwan affairs office and information office on 21 february was based on the resolution of the political bureau .
the main points of the political bureau 's resolution are as follows : 1 .
determine the state 's reunification a major agenda of the whole party and entire army in the first decade of the new century . 2 . continue to adhere to the basic policy of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " toward taiwan . 3 .
the worsening of situation in the taiwan strait at present and the arrogance of the taiwan independence forces are mainly due to the pursuit of a hegemonist strategy by the united states directed at china and to the " taiwan relations act . "
the united states is the biggest stumbling block to solving the taiwan issue . 6 .
there is a need to make good military preparations for using force to solve the taiwan issue and to enhance high - technology deterrent deployment .
a military source in beijing pointed out that jiang zemin 's recent " fear nothing " remarks show that china is not afraid of the us hegemonist military aggression .
on 2 march jiang zemin told former us president bush in a clear manner that china must be reunited , that china has been quite patient , and that it will not wait for another ten or twenty years .
it is impossible for china to develop relations with the united states under the circumstance of the united states ' interfering in china 's internal affairs .
this again demonstrates china 's strong determination to solve the taiwan issue .
reportedly , this trip of top mainland military levels indicates that the top cpc hierarchy 's high vigilance against taiwan 's upcoming presidential elections is more or less the same as in 1996 .
in order to prevent any contingencies ( turmoil ) that may occur in taiwan on saturday , the voting day , beijing has urged the troops of the nanjing and guangzhou theaters to be " well prepared . "
in order to prevent the taiwan authorities from indefinitely dragging out the cross - strait talks , the mainland 's top military levels have kept on exerting certain pressure on taiwan .
in february this year , chi haotian also went to the guangzhou theater , where he openly inspected the shenzhen base of the pla troops stationed in hong kong and the zhuhai base of the troops stationed in macao .
the military action will be focused on stepped up monitoring and patrols .
some of the officers ' relatives said that the situation of the army units was not so tense during their stay there over the past month or so .
they also stepped up their training . a military source said that the situation of current cross - strait ties is changeable and the period is crucial .
there is no need to be panic because it is quite normal and reasonable for the troops stationed along the coast to be on alert and to be prepared for all contingencies .
hohhot , 13 mar ( xinhua ) - - as we bid farewell to the last century and herald in a new century , the cpc central committee and the state council made a strategic decision on the grand development of china 's western regions .
covering for this article , this reporter found that some regions simply see the grand western development strategy as the state 's injecting money to their regions , as the state 's granting preferential policies to their regions , and as an increase of more projects for their regions .
when drawing up a blueprint for the development of western regions , one must consider things in line with the market economic laws , one must rely on policies to regulate and control the market , and one must let the market do the promotion and development .
